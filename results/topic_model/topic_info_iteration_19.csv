-1,12862,-1_genes_genetic_gene_species,"['Fine-scale spatial genetic structure and gene dispersal in Silene latifolia Plants are sessile organisms, often characterized by limited dispersal. Seeds and pollen are the critical stages for gene flow. Here we investigate spatial genetic structure, gene dispersal and the relative contribution of pollen vs seed in the movement of genes in a stable metapopulation of the white campion Silene latifolia within its native range. This short-lived perennial plant is dioecious, has gravity-dispersed seeds and moth-mediated pollination. Direct measures of pollen dispersal suggested that large populations receive more pollen than small isolated populations and that most gene flow occurs within tens of meters. However, these studies were performed in the newly colonized range (North America) where the specialist pollinator is absent. In the native range (Europe), gene dispersal could fall on a different spatial scale. We genotyped 258 individuals from large and small (15) subpopulations along a 60 km, elongated meta-population in Europe using six highly variable microsatellite markers, two X-linked and four autosomal. We found substantial genetic differentiation among subpopulations (global F-ST = 0.11) and a general pattern of isolation by distance over the whole sampled area. Spatial autocorrelation revealed high relatedness among neighboring individuals over hundreds of meters. Estimates of gene dispersal revealed gene flow at the scale of tens of meters (5-30 m), similar to the newly colonized range. Contrary to expectations, estimates of dispersal based on X and autosomal markers showed very similar ranges, suggesting similar levels of pollen and seed dispersal. This may be explained by stochastic events of extensive seed dispersal in this area and limited pollen dispersal.

Due to this new insight the number of single cell studies rises continuously (for recent reviews see (1,2,3)). However, many of the single cell techniques applied do not allow monitoring the development and behavior of one specific single cell in time (e.g. flow cytometry or standard microscopy). Here, we provide a detailed description of a microscopy method used in several recent studies (4, 5, 6, 7), which allows following and recording (fluorescence of) individual bacterial cells of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae through growth and division for many generations. The resulting movies can be used to construct phylogenetic lineage trees by tracing back the history of a single cell within a population that originated from one common ancestor. This time-lapse fluorescence microscopy method cannot only be used to investigate growth, division and differentiation of individual cells, but also to analyze the effect of cell history and ancestry on specific cellular behavior. Furthermore, time-lapse microscopy is ideally suited to examine gene expression dynamics and protein localization during the bacterial cell cycle. The method explains how to prepare the bacterial cells and construct the microscope slide to enable the outgrowth of single cells into a microcolony. In short, single cells are spotted on a semi-solid surface consisting of growth medium supplemented with agarose on which they grow and divide under a fluorescence microscope within a temperature controlled environmental chamber. Images are captured at specific intervals and are later analyzed using the open source software ImageJ.', 'Growth-trait relationships in subtropical forest are stronger at higher diversity Understanding how species diversity affects plant performance is a central question in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research. At the community level, functional trait means and trait dissimilarities have been used to explain biodiversity effects, but with mixed success. To disentangle how functional traits explain community growth and underpin biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, we should elucidate how plant traits affect individual growth across species richness levels, because the role of functional traits on growth depends on the ecological context of the individual. We addressed this topic by using detailed data of twelve functional traits and annual growth for 529 individual trees of 31 species at five species-richness levels in a large forest biodiversity experiment in south-east China from 4 to 9 years after planting. Our analyses show first that individual trait values can change with species richness, indicating that trait values can change due to the biotic context. Secondly, we show that early tree growth is more strongly affected by traits than by species richness. Finally, our data show that growth-trait relationships can change with species richness and with forest age. Trait effects on growth are more pronounced at higher richness levels, indicating that measuring traits on individual trees across richness levels can improve growth predictions and inference of BEF relationships that are shaped by functional traits. Synthesis. This study shows that functional trait values and their effect on individual tree growth depend on species richness. Our data support the notion that to elucidate how functional traits shape biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, an important step is to consider the biotic context of individual trees within a community. We have made an initial step by analysing how functional traits affect individual-tree growth in a diversity-dependent manner and future research should continue by elucidating the role of traits on tree-tree interactions across diversity levels.']","['genes', 'genetic', 'gene', 'species', 'populations', 'diversity', 'analysis', 'population', 'plants', 'dependent']",biology,Genetics,genetics,biology,Genetic Diversity,Genetic Diversity in Populations,19

Phenylboronic acid (PBA) moieties in the polymer backbone provided binding to surfaces, forming reversible covalent complexes with cis-diols found in many biological molecules. Pendant poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains sterically protected those surfaces from subsequent interactions with other proteins and cells. The PEG and PBA grafting ratios on these poly-L-lysine-graft-(PEG;PBA) copolymers [PLL-g-(PEG;PBA)] were varied, and the polymers were tested in models relevant to undesirable wound-healing responses such as peritoneal adhesion formation and posterior capsule opacification. PLL-g-(PEG;PBA) polymers spontaneously coated tissue culture polystyrene and completely blocked rabbit lens epithelial cell adhesion to the surface over a wide range of PEG grafting ratios. PLL-g-(PEG;PBA)s with optimal grafting ratios were able to coat adsorbed serum proteins or extracellular matrices and block cell spreading on the surfaces at 4 h, although the effect was lost within 24 h. The polymer also enhanced the efficacy of surgical lysis of peritoneal adhesions in rats. The reversible covalent complexes formed by the PBA moieties on the copolymer backbone were more effective at binding biological surfaces than electrostatic interactions formed via a copolymer lacking the PBA moieties, that is, PLL-g-PEG. (C) 2001 John Wiley Sons, Inc.', 'Synthesis of polymer network scaffolds from L-lactide and poly(ethylene glycol) and their interaction with cells New lactide-based poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer networks (GL-PEGs) have been prepared by UV photopolymerization using two nontoxic macromers, triacrylated lactic acid oligomer emanating from a glycerol center (GL) and monoacrylated PEG. These materials have been developed for use as polymer scaffolds in tissue engineering, which have cell-adhesion resistant, ligand-immobilizable, and biodegradable characteristics. The GL-PEG cross-linked polymer networks obtained were glassy and transparent, and the gel content was approximately 90%, irrespective of the degree of polymerization of lactide on the glycerol center and the amount and molecular weight of the PEG acrylate incorporated. All networks showed relatively low swelling in water, due to their highly cross-linked nature. They had no melting endotherms, but they displayed glass transition temperatures indicative of phase-mixing of the PEG. Analysis by ESCA, contact angle measurement, and cell culture indicated the presence of PEG at the network surfaces and showed that higher molecular weight PEG was incorporated into the network surfaces to a higher extent, rendered the surfaces more hydrophilic, and repelled cell adhesion more effectively than did PEG of lower molecular weights. All GL networks showed much less adhesion and spreading of human foreskin fibroblasts than glass used as a control: In particular, GL-PEG networks were highly resistant to cell adhesion due to the mobile PEG chains. Given that the terminal hydroxyl function on the incorporated PEG can be readily derivatized with a bioactive peptide, these degradable networks should be useful as polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering.', 'Single-Molecule Adhesion of a Stimuli-Responsive Oligo(ethylene glycol) Copolymer to Gold Adhesion of environmentally responsive polymers to biocompatible surfaces is an important issue that has been explored in several nanobiotechnology applications. Here, we prepared multi-responsive statistical copolymers of two oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate macromonomers with differing ethylene glycol side chain lengths using RAFT polymerization. The lower critical solution temperature of the copolymers was characterized using visible light extinction, and the chemical composition and molecular weight were measured using NMR spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography, respectively. The characterization results demonstrated that the transition temperature could be controlled by varying the macromonomer feed ratios, and the molecular weight could be controlled by varying the amount of the RAFT chain transfer agent in the polymerization feed. Using AFM single-molecule force spectroscopy, we measured the adhesion characteristics of single copolymer molecules to a gold surface. We found that dehydration and collapse of the copolymer in a high ionic strength buffer resulted in dramatically reduced bridging length distributions that maintained their single-molecule bimodal character. In the collapsed state, the polymer exhibited a lower absolute desorption force while cooperativity effects were found to increase the desorption force per chain for multi-chain interactions. Our results confirmed that the polymer in a collapsed conformation exhibited a dramatically reduced volume occupancy above the gold surface. These results demonstrate at the single-molecule level how solvent-induced collapse of an environmentally responsive copolymer modulates surface adhesion forces and bridging length distributions in a controllable way.']","['polymers', 'polymer', 'polymerization', 'copolymers', 'polyethylene', 'copolymer', 'propylene', 'molecular', 'molecules', 'hydrogel']",polymerization,Polymers,Polymers,polymerization,Polymer Chemistry,Polymer Science,19
1,559,1_cytokine_immune_immunity_lymphocyte,"['SUPPRESSION OF VIRUS-SPECIFIC ANTIBODY-PRODUCTION BY CD8+ CLASS I-RESTRICTED ANTIVIRAL CYTOTOXIC T-CELLS INVIVO The question of whether virus-induced immunosuppression includes the antibody response against the infecting virus itself was evaluated in a model situation. Transgenic mice expressing the T-cell receptor (TCR) specific for peptide 32-42 of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoprotein 1 presented by D(b) reacted with a strong transgenic cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response starting on day 3 after infection with a high dose (10(6) PFU intravenously [i.v.]) of the WE strain of LCMV (LCMV-WE); LCMV-specific antibody production in the spleen was suppressed in these mice. Low-dose (10(2) PFU i.v.) infection resulted in an antiviral antibody response comparable to that of the transgene-negative littermates. The induction of suppression of LCMV-specific antibody responses was specifically mediated by CD8+ TCR transgenic CTLs, since the LCMV-8.7 variant virus (which is not recognized by transgenic TCR-expressing CTLs because of a point mutation) did not induce suppression. In addition, treatment with CD8 monoclonal antibody in vivo abrogated suppression. Once suppression had been established, it was found to be nonspecific. The abrogation of antibody responses depended on the relative kinetics of the antibody response involved and the kinetics of the anti-LCMV CTL response. Analysis of T- and B-cell subpopulations showed no significant changes, but immunohistochemical analysis of spleens revealed extensive destruction of follicular organization in lymphoid tissue by day 4 in transgenic mice infected with LCMV-WE but not in those infected with the CTL escape mutant LCMV-8.7. Impairment of antigen presentation rather than of T or B cells was also suggested by adoptive transfer experiments, showing that transferred infected macrophages may improve the anti-LCMV antibody response in LCMV-immunosuppressed transgenic recipients; also, T and B cells from suppressed transgenic mice did respond in irradiated and virus-infected nontransgenic mice with antibody formation to LCMV. Such virus-triggered, T-cell-mediated immunopathology causing the suppression of B cells and of protective antibody responses, including those against the infecting virus itself, may permit certain viruses to establish persistent infections.', 'Virus-specific MHC class II-restricted TCR-transgenic mice: effects on humoral and cellular immune responses after viral infection A transgenic mouse expressing MHC class Ii-restricted TCR with specificity for a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoprotein-derived T helper cell epitope was developed to study the role of LCMV-specific CD4(+) T cells in virus infection in vivo. The majority of CD4(+) T cells in TCR transgenic mice expressed the transgenic receptor, and LCMV glycoprotein-specific TCR transgenic CD4(+) T cells efficiently mediated help for the production of LCMV glycoprotein-specific isotype-switched antibodies. In contrast, LCMV glycoprotein-specific TCR transgenic mice exhibited a drastically reduced ability to provide help for the generation of antibody responses specific for the virus-internal nucleoprotein, indicating that intramolecular/intrastructural help is limited to antigens that are accessible to B cells on the viral surface. Antiviral cellular immunity was studied with noncytopathic LCMV and recombinant cytopathic vaccinia virus expressing the LCMV glycoprotein. TCR transgenic mice failed to efficiently control LCMV infection, demonstrating that functional LCMV-specific CD4(+) T cells - even if activated and present at extremely high frequencies - cannot directly mediate protective immunity against LCMV, Despite the fact that LCMV-primed CD4(+) T cells from TCR transgenic mice as well as from control mice showed low MHC class II-restricted cytotoxic activity in vivo, this did not correlate with protection against LCMV replication in vivo. In contrast, CD4(+) T cells from TCR-transgenic mice mediated efficient protection against infection with recombinant vaccinia virus. These results further support the need for different immune effector functions for protective immunity against different viral infections.', 'Aplastic anemia rescued by exhaustion of cytokine-secreting CD8(+) T cells in persistent infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Aplastic anemia may be associated with persistent viral infections that result from failure of the immune system to control virus. To evaluate the effects on hematopoiesis exerted by sustained viral replication in the presence of activated T cells, blood values and bone marrow (BM) function were analyzed in chronic infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in perforin-deficient (P-0/0) mice. These mice exhibit a vigorous T cell response, but are unable to eliminate the virus. Within 14 d after infection, a progressive pancytopenia developed that eventually was lethal due to agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia correlating with an increasing loss of morphologically differentiated, pluripotent, and committed progenitors in the BM. This hematopoietic disease caused by a noncytopathic chronic virus infection was prevented by depletion of CD8(+), but not of CD4(+), T cells and accelerated by increasing the frequency of LCMV-specific CD8(+) T cells in T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic (tg) mice. LCMV and CD8(+) T cells were found only transiently in the BM of infected wild-type mice. In contrast, increased numbers of CD8(+) T cells and LCMV persisted at high levels in antigen-presenting cells of infected P-0/0 and P-0/0 X TCR tg mice. No cognate interaction between the TCR and hematopoietic progenitors presenting either LCMV-derived or self-antigens on the major histocompatibility complex was found, but damage to hematopoiesis was due to excessive secretion and action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/lymphotoxin (LT)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma produced by CD8(+) T cells. This was studied in double-knockout mice that were genetically deficient in perforin and TNF receptor type 1. Compared with P-0/0 mice, these mice had identical T cell compartments and T cell responses to LCMV, yet they survived LCMV infection and became life-long virus carriers. The numbers of hematopoietic precursors in the BM were increased compared with P-0/0 mice after LCMV infection, although transient blood disease was still noticed. This residual disease activity was found to depend on IFN-gamma-producing LCMV-specific T cells and the time point of hematopoietic recovery paralleled disappearance of these virus-specific, IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T cells. Thus, in the absence of IFN-gamma and/or TNF/LT-alpha, exhaustion of virus-specific T cells was not hampered.']","['cytokine', 'immune', 'immunity', 'lymphocyte', 'lymphocytic', 'lymphocytes', 'antiviral', 'antigen', 'antigens', 'viral']",antigen,Immunology,Immunology,antigen,Immune Response,Immune Response,19
2,505,2_tuberculosis_mycobacteria_mycobacterium_mycobacterial,"['Within Host Evolution Selects for a Dominant Genotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis while T Cells Increase Pathogen Genetic Diversity Molecular epidemiological assessments, drug treatment optimization, and development of immunological interventions all depend on understanding pathogen adaptation and genetic variation, which differ for specific pathogens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an exceptionally successful human pathogen, yet beyond knowledge that this bacterium has low overall genomic variation but acquires drug resistance mutations, little is known of the factors that drive its population genomic characteristics. Here, we compared the genetic diversity of the bacteria that established infection to the bacterial populations obtained from infected tissues during murine M. tuberculosis pulmonary infection and human disseminated M. bovis BCG infection. We found that new mutations accumulate during in vitro culture, but that in vivo, purifying selection against new mutations dominates, indicating that M. tuberculosis follows a dominant lineage model of evolution. Comparing bacterial populations passaged in T cell-deficient and immunocompetent mice, we found that the presence of T cells is associated with an increase in the diversity of the M. tuberculosis genome. Together, our findings put M. tuberculosis genetic evolution in a new perspective and clarify the impact of T cells on sequence diversity of M. tuberculosis.', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis associated with severe tuberculosis evades cytosolic surveillance systems and modulates IL-1 beta production Genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis affects immune responses and clinical outcomes of tuberculosis (TB). However, how bacterial diversity orchestrates immune responses to direct distinct TB severities is unknown. Here we study 681 patients with pulmonary TB and show that M. tuberculosis isolates from cases with mild disease consistently induce robust cytokine responses in macrophages across multiple donors. By contrast, bacteria from patients with severe TB do not do so. Secretion of IL-1 beta is a good surrogate of the differences observed, and thus to classify strains as probable drivers of different TB severities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that M. tuberculosis isolates that induce low levels of IL-1 beta production can evade macrophage cytosolic surveillance systems, including cGAS and the inflammasome. Isolates exhibiting this evasion strategy carry candidate mutations, generating sigA recognition boxes or affecting components of the ESX-1 secretion system. Therefore, we provide evidence that M. tuberculosis strains manipulate host-pathogen interactions to drive variable TB severities. Some strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis seem to be able to avoid host defense systems. Here the authors stratify patients by severity of tuberculosis and find correlations with the level of IL-1 beta production by macrophages exposed to these isolates.', ""Macro-array and bioinformatic analyses reveal mycobacterial 'core' genes, variation in the ESAT-6 gene family and new phylogenetic markers for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex To better understand the biology and the virulence determinants of the two major mycobacterial human pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae, their genome sequences have been determined recently. In silico comparisons revealed that among the 1439 genes common to both M. tuberculosis and M. leprae, 219 genes code for proteins that show no similarity with proteins from other organisms. Therefore, the latter 'core' genes could be specific for mycobacteria or even for the intracellular mycobacterial pathogens. To obtain more information as to whether these genes really were mycobacteria-specific, they were included in a focused macro-array, which also contained genes from previously defined regions of difference (RD) known to be absent from Mycobacterium bovis BCG relative to M. tuberculosis. Hybridization of DNA from 40 strains of the M. tuberculosis complex and in silico comparison of these genes with the near-complete genome sequences from Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium smegmatis were undertaken to answer this question. The results showed that among the 219 conserved genes, very few were not present in all the strains tested. Some of these missing genes code for proteins of the ESAT-6 family, a group of highly immunogenic small proteins whose presence and number is variable among the genomically highly conserved members of the M. tuberculosis complex. Indeed, the results suggest that, with few exceptions, the 'core' genes conserved among M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. leprae are also highly conserved among other mycobacterial strains, which makes them interesting potential targets for developing new specific anti-mycobacterial drugs. In contrast, the genes from RD regions showed great variability among certain members of the M. tuberculosis complex, and some new specific deletions in Mycobacterium canettii, Mycobacterium microti and seal isolates were identified and further characterized during this study. Together with the distribution of a particular 6 or 7 bp micro-deletion in the gene encoding the polyketide synthase pks15/1, these results confirm and further extend the revised phylogenetic model for the M. tuberculosis complex recently presented.""]","['tuberculosis', 'mycobacteria', 'mycobacterium', 'mycobacterial', 'bacteria', 'bacterial', 'pathogen', 'genome', 'genes', 'infection']",mycobacteria,Mycobacterium,Tuberculosis,mycobacteria,Tuberculosis Pathogen,Mycobacterial Infections,19
3,457,3_biodiversity_ecosystems_ecosystem_ecological,"['Selection in response to community diversity alters plant performance and functional traits In grassland biodiversity experiments the positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship generally increases over time. However, we know little about the underlying short-term evolutionary processes. Using five plant species selected for twelve years in a biodiversity experiment in mixture or monoculture and plants without such a selection history, we assessed whether differential selection altered productivity, biodiversity effects, and functional trait differences within newly assembled monocultures and 2-species mixtures. Plants without a past community selection history in the biodiversity experiment produced the lowest assemblage biomass and showed the weakest biodiversity effects. In newly assembled mixtures, plants with a selection history in mixtures produced more biomass than plants with a monoculture selection history. Biodiversity effects were generally positive and differed significantly between selection histories. However, contrary to our expectations, biodiversity effects were not stronger for mixture-type plants. Biodiversity effects were influenced by both trait differences between plants and community-weighted means, but these relationships were mostly independent of selection history. Our findings suggest that twelve years of selection history in monocultures or species mixtures differentiated plants of each species into monoculture-and mixture-types. Such rapid evolution of different community-types within grassland species and its effect on ecosystem services and functioning are likely to be important for species conservation practice.', 'Plant diversity effects on grassland productivity are robust to both nutrient enrichment and drought Global change drivers are rapidly altering resource availability and biodiversity. While there is consensus that greater biodiversity increases the functioning of ecosystems, the extent to which biodiversity buffers ecosystem productivity in response to changes in resource availability remains unclear. We use data from 16 grassland experiments across North America and Europe that manipulated plant species richness and one of two essential resources-soil nutrients or water-to assess the direction and strength of the interaction between plant diversity and resource alteration on above-ground productivity and net biodiversity, complementarity, and selection effects. Despite strong increases in productivity with nutrient addition and decreases in productivity with drought, we found that resource alterations did not alter biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Our results suggest that these relationships are largely determined by increases in cornplementarity effects along plant species richness gradients. Although nutrient addition reduced complementarity effects at high diversity, this appears to be due to high biomass in monocultures under nutrient enrichment. Our results indicate that diversity and the complementarity of species are important regulators of grassland ecosystem productivity, regardless of changes in other drivers of ecosystem function.', 'Recovery of ecosystem functions after experimental disturbance in 73 grasslands differing in land-use intensity, plant species richness and community composition Drivers of ecosystem stability have been a major topic in ecology for decades. Most studies have focused on the influence of species richness on ecosystem stability and found positive diversity-stability relationships. However, land use and abiotic factors shape species richness and functional composition of plant communities and may override species richness-stability relations in managed grasslands. We analysed the relative importance of land-use intensity (LUI), resident plant species richness and functional composition for recovery of plant communities (plant species richness, plant cover, above- and below-ground biomass) and release of soil nutrients after a severe mechanical disturbance. Experimental sward disturbance was applied to 73 grassland sites along a LUI gradient in three German regions. We considered relative (ln(disturbance/control)) and absolute (disturbance - control) treatment effects. Using structural equation modelling, we disentangled direct effects of LUI and resident species richness on recovery and indirect effects via changes in functional richness. Community-weighted-mean traits rarely mattered for recovery or nutrient release, while functional richness especially increased relative recovery of plant communities but also relative release of NO3-N and NH4-N. These effects were enhanced by increasing resident plant species richness and decreasing LUI. Next to these indirect influences of LUI and resident plant species richness via functional community composition, grasslands of high compared with grasslands of low resident plant species richness generally showed decreased recovery of plant communities. In grasslands of high LUI, absolute recovery of some aspects of plant communities was decreased. We did not find consistent differences between the relative importance of the different drivers of recovery after the first and the second season. Overall, resident species richness seemed most important for relative recovery and less important for absolute recovery, where direct effects of LUI were more common. Synthesis. The stability of ecosystems in managed grasslands depends on more than species richness. Thus, drivers that directly affect species richness and functional community composition have to be considered when studying the stability of real-world ecosystems. More specifically, in managed grasslands high resident species richness but also high land-use intensity (LUI) decreased the stability of ecosystem functions, which was partially buffered by increases in functional richness.']","['biodiversity', 'ecosystems', 'ecosystem', 'ecological', 'vegetation', 'conservation', 'species', 'grasslands', 'diversity', 'plants']",biodiversity,Ecology,biodiversity,biodiversity,Biodiversity Conservation,Ecosystem Diversity,19

The isolated cDNA is about 2.7 kb in length. The deduced polypeptide chain for ERGIC-53 consists of 510 amino acids (M(r) 54217) including an N-terminal signal sequence of 30 amino acids, a single putative transmembrane segment of 18 amino acids, and a short cytoplasmic domain of 12 amino acids. Surprisingly, the cytoplasmic segment contains two lysines positioned three and four residues from the C-terminus. Such a double lysine motif is known to function as a retention signal for a group of membrane proteins associated with the ER. Expression of a full-length cDNA of ERGIC-53 in Vero cells revealed intracellular localization similar but not always identical to the endogenously expressed ERGIC-53. The presence of an ER retention motif in a protein of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment has important implications for the retention mechanism mediated by this signal.', 'The recycling of ERGIC-53 in the early secretory pathway - ERGIC-53 carries a cytosolic endoplasmic reticulum exit determinant interacting with COPII Further investigation of the targeting of the intracellular membrane lectin endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment-53 (ERGIC-53) by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that its lumenal and transmembrane domains together confer ER retention. In addition we show that the cytoplasmic domain is required for exit from the ER indicating that ERGIC-53 carries an ER-exit determinant. Two phenylalanines at the C terminus are essential for ER-exit. Thus, ERGIC-53 contains determinants for ER retention as well as anterograde transport which, in conjunction with a dilysine ER retrieval signal, control the continuous recycling of ERGIC-53 in the early secretory pathway, In vitro binding studies revealed a specific phenylalanine-dependent interaction between an ERGIC-53 cytosolic tail peptide and the COPII coat component Sec23p. These results suggest that the ER-exit of ERGIC-53 is mediated by direct interaction of its cytosolic tail with the Sec23p.Sec24p complex of COPII and that protein sorting at the level of the ER occurs by a mechanism similar to receptor-mediated endocytosis or Golgi to ER retrograde transport.', 'Retrograde Traffic from the Golgi to the Endoplasmic Reticulum Proteins to be secreted are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus. The transport of these proteins requires the localization and activity of proteins that create ER exit sites, coat proteins to collect cargo and to reshape the membrane into a transport container, and address labels-SNARE proteins-to target the vesicles specifically to the Golgi apparatus. In addition some proteins may need export chaperones or export receptors to enable their exit into transport vesicles. ER export factors, SNAREs, and misfolded Golgi-resident proteins must all be retrieved from the Golgi to the ER again. This retrieval is also part of the organellar homeostasis pathway essential to maintaining the identity of the ER and of the Golgi apparatus. In this review, I will discuss the different processes in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER and highlight the mechanistic insights we have obtained in the last couple of years.']","['proteins', 'transmembrane', 'protein', 'reticulum', 'peptide', 'endosomal', 'membrane', 'membranes', 'organelles', 'endoplasmic']",biology,Membranes,membranes,endoplasmic reticulum,Membrane Proteins,Membrane Proteins,19

A combined treatment has been suggested as a strategy for transmission control. Recent laboratory experiments with rabbits with a mixed infection of Schistosoma japonicum parasites of different ages confirmed the effectiveness of a combination therapy. In the present work. we assessed the effect of a combined treatment on adult worms of S. japonicum and found significantly higher worm reduction rates than with a single dose of praziquantel. In a next step, we extended the study of the combined treatment to Schistosoma mansoni. A combined treatment with 75 mg/kg praziquantel and 150 mg/kg artemether was administered to hamsters infected with juvenile and adult S. mansoni. The two drugs, administered simultaneously or spaced by 6 h, 1, 3 or 7 days, resulted in significantly higher worm reduction rates than a single treatment with praziquantel. A combination therapy with increased doses of 100 mg/kg praziquantel and 300 mg/kg artemether showed very high worm reduction rates of 90% and above, however, some hamsters died in five different combined treatment experiments, suggesting that these drug concentrations were too high. We conclude that a combined treatment with praziquantel and artemether at the lower doses is safe and more effective than praziquantel alone, which forms a foundation for designing respective clinical trials in humans.

All rights reserved.', ""Effectiveness of school-based preventive chemotherapy strategies for sustaining the control of schistosomiasis in Cote d'Ivoire: Results of a 5-year cluster randomized trial The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel as the global strategy for morbidity control of schistosomiasis. The guidelines include target groups and treatment frequencies based on prevalence in school-age children. However, these recommendations are based on expert opinion. The Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) put forward a series of cluster-randomized trials in different African countries, including Cote d'Ivoire, to identify the most suitable approach to gain and sustain the control of schistosomiasis. Results from Cote d'Ivoire did not show statistically significant differences between three school-based treatment schedules (i.e., annual treatment over four years; treatment only in the first two years, followed by two years whithout treatment; and treatment every other year without treatment in-between) in reducing prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection among children aged 9-12 years. The results in first-grade children with an age of 5-8 years entering school who had never received deworming drugs showed no significant difference in the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection between the different treatments at the study end, suggesting that the three strategies were not significantly different for reducing the disease transmission in affected communities. However, our data should be combined with other SCORE studies carried out elsewhere in Africa. A meta-analysis including the results of the sister trials could help to conclude and make more generic recommendations. Preventive chemotherapy using praziquantel is the mainstay for schistosomiasis control. However, there is little evidence on what is supposed to be the most effective school-based treatment strategy to sustain morbidity control. The aim of this study was to compare differences in Schistosoma mansoni prevalence and infection intensity between three different schedules of school-based preventive chemotherapy in an area with moderate prevalence of S. mansoni in Cote d'Ivoire. Principal findings Author summary Overall, 7,410 children aged 9-12 years were examined at baseline and 7,223 at the final survey. The baseline prevalence of S. mansoni was 17.4%, 20.2%, and 25.2% in arms 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In the final year, we observed the lowest prevalence of 10.4% in arm 1, compared to 18.2% in arm 2 and 17.5% in arm 3. The comparison between arms 1 and 2 estimated an odds ratio (OR) of 0.52 but the difference was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-1.16). Likewise the difference between arms 1 and 3 lacked statistical significance (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.23-1.29). There was no noteworthy difference observed between arms 2 and 3 (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.64-1.75). The lowest S. mansoni fecal egg counts in the final year survey were observed in arm 1 (7.9 eggs per gram of stool (EPG)). However, compared with 11.5 EPG in arm 2 and 15.4 EPG in arm 3, the difference lacked statistical significance. There were 4,812 first-grade children examined at baseline and 4,513 in the final survey. The overall prevalence of S. mansoni in these children slightly decreased in arms 1 (from 4.5% to 3.6%) and 2 (from 4.7% to 4.3%), but increased in arm 3 (from 6.8% to 7.9%). However, there was no significant difference in prevalence and infection intensity observed between study arms. Methodology Seventy-five schools were randomly assigned to one of three intervention arms: (i) annual school-based preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel (40 mg/kg) over four years; (ii) praziquantel treatment only in the first two years, followed by two years whithout treatment; and (iii) praziquantel treatment in years 1 and 3 without treatment in-between. Cross-sectional parasitologic surveys were carried out prior to each round of preventive chemotherapy. The difference in S. mansoni prevalence and infection intensity was assessed by multiple Kato-Katz thick smears, among children aged 9-12 years at the time of each survey. First-grade children, aged 5-8 years who had never received praziquantel, were also tested at baseline and at the end of the study. The three treatment schedules investigated led to a reduction in the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection among children aged 9-12 years. Comparing intervention arms at the end of the study, no statistically significant differences were observed between annual treatement and the other two treatment schedules, neither in reduction of prevalence nor intensity of infection. It is important to combine our results with those of three sister trials conducted simultaneously in other African countries, before final recommendations can be drawn. Conclusions/significance Background"", ""Bayesian Risk Mapping and Model-Based Estimation of Schistosoma haematobium-Schistosoma mansoni Co-distribution in Cote d'Ivoire Background. Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni are blood flukes that cause urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis, respectively. In Cote d'Ivoire, both species are endemic and control efforts are being scaled up. Accurate knowledge of the geographical distribution, including delineation of high-risk areas, is a central feature for spatial targeting of interventions. Thus far, model-based predictive risk mapping of schistosomiasis has relied on historical data of separate parasite species. Principal Findings: We estimated that 8.9% of school-aged children in Cote d'Ivoire are affected by schistosomiasis; 5.3% with S. haematobium and 3.8% with S. mansoni. Approximately 2 million annualized praziquantel treatments would be required for preventive chemotherapy at health districts level. The distinct spatial patterns of S. haematobium and S. mansoni imply that co-infection is of little importance across the country. Methodology: We analyzed data pertaining to Schistosoma infection among school-aged children obtained from a national, cross-sectional survey conducted between November 2011 and February 2012. More than 5,000 children in 92 schools across Cote d'Ivoire participated. Bayesian geostatistical multinomial models were developed to assess infection risk, including S. haematobium-S. mansoni co-infection. The predicted risk of schistosomiasis was utilized to estimate the number of children that need preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel according to World Health Organization guidelines. Conclusions/Significance: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the spatial distribution of schistosomiasis risk among school-aged children in Cote d'Ivoire and a strong empirical basis for a rational targeting of control interventions.""]","['schistosomiasis', 'schistosoma', 'schistosomula', 'infections', 'haematobium', 'infection', 'infected', 'praziquantel', 'mebendazole', 'artemether']",schistosomiasis,Schistosomiasis,Schistosomiasis,schistosomiasis,Schistosomiasis Infections,Schistosomiasis Infection,19

Such amounts of material continuously increase protein database sizes. At present, 991 times more protein sequences are available in the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL databases than 8 years ago in SWISS-PROT. One of the methods of choice for protein identification makes use of specific endoproteolytic cleavage followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionisation mass spectrometric (MALDI-MS) analysis of the digested product. Since 1993, when this technique was first demonstrated., the conditions required for a correct identification have changed dramatically. Whilst 4-5 peptides with an uncertainty of 2-3 Da were sufficient for a correct identification in 1993,10-13 peptides with less than 60 ppm mass error are now required for human and E coli proteins. This evolution is directly related to the continuous increase in protein database sizes, which causes an increase in the number of false positive matches in identification results. Use of an information complement deduced from the primary protein sequence, in the process of identification by peptide mass fingerprints, can help to increase confidence in the identification results. In this article, we propose the exchange of labile hydrogen atoms with deuterium atoms to provide an alternative information complement. The exchange reaction with optimised techniques has shown an average 95% of hydrogen/denterium (H/D) exchange on tryptic peptides. This level of exchange was sufficient to single out one or more peptides from a list of potential candidate proteins due to the dependence of H/D exchange on the peptide primary structure. This technique also has clear advantages in the identification of small proteins where direct protein identification is impaired by the limited number of endoproteolytic peptides. Then, information related to primary sequence obtained with this technique could help to identify proteins with high confidence without any expensive tandem mass spectrometry instruments.

Significant improvements have been made during the last few years in technologies for high-throughput proteomics, both at the level of data analysis software and mass spectrometry hardware. As proteomics technologies advance and become more widely accessible, efforts of cataloguing and quantifying full proteomes are underway to complement other genomics approaches, such as RNA and metabolite profiling. Of particular interest is the application of proteome data to improve genome annotation and to include information on post-translational protein modifications with the annotation of the corresponding gene. This type of analysis requires a paradigm shift because amino acid sequences must be assigned to peptides without relying on existing protein databases. In this review, advances and current limitations of full proteome analysis are briefly highlighted using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana as an example. Strategies to identify peptides are also discussed on the basis of MS/MS data in a protein database-independent approach.', 'Trypsin catalyzed O-16-to-O-18 exchange for comparative proteomics: Tandem mass spectrometry comparison using MALDI-TOF, ESI-QTOF, and ESI-Ion trap mass spectrometers Quantitative or comparative proteome analysis was initially performed with 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis with the inherent disadvantages of being biased towards certain proteins and being labor intensive. Alternative mass spectrometry-based approaches in conjunction with gel-free protein/peptide separation have been developed in recent years using various stable isotope labeling techniques. Common to all these techniques is the incorporation, biosynthetically or chemically, of a labeling moiety having either a natural isotope distribution of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, or nitrogen (light form) or being enriched with heavy isotopes like deuterium, C-13, O-18, or N-15, respectively. By mixing equal amounts of a control sample possessing for instance the light form of the label with a heavy-labeled case sample, differentially labeled peptides are detected by mass spectrometric methods and their intensities serve as a means for direct relative protein quantification. While each of the different labeling methods has its advantages and disadvantages, the endoprotease O-16-to-O-18 catalyzed oxygen exchange at the C-terminal carboxylic acid is extremely promising because of the specificity assured by the enzymatic reaction and the labeling of essentially every protease-derived peptide. We show here that this methodology is applicable to complex biological samples such as a subfraction of human plasma. Furthermore, despite the relatively small mass difference of 4 Da between the two labeled forms, corresponding to the exchange of two oxygen atoms by two 180 isotopes, it is possible to quantify differentially labeled proteins on an ion trap mass spectrometer with a mass resolution of about 2000 in automated data dependent LC-MS/MS acquisition mode. Post column sample deposition on a MALDI target parallel to on-line ESI-MS/MS enables the analysis of the same compounds by means of ESI-and MALDI-MS/MS. This has the potential to increase the confidence in the quantification results as well as to increase the sequence coverage of potentially interesting proteins by complementary peptide ionization techniques. Additionally the paired y-ion signals in tandem mass spectra of O-16/O-18-labeled peptide pairs provide a means to confirm automatic protein identification results or even to assist de novo sequencing of yet unknown proteins.

8,377,8_anxiety_conditioning_stress_stimulus,"['Individual differences in anxiety trait are related to spatial learning abilities and hippocampal expression of mineralocorticoid receptors Although high levels of anxiety might be expected to negatively influence learning and memory, it remains to be shown whether individual differences in anxiety may influence spatial learning and memory in outbred rat populations. We have studied this possibility in male Wistar rats whose levels of anxiety were first characterized as either high (HA) or low (LA) according to their behavior in the elevated plus maze or in the open field test. Subsequently, their performance in the Morris water maze was studied, a task dependent on hippocampal activity. Interestingly, LA rats showed a faster acquisition and better memory in the water maze when compared to HA rats. Indeed, this difference in performance could mainly be attributed to the increase in thigmotactic behavior (swimming in circles close to the maze walls) displayed by HA rats during spatial navigation. Glucocorticoids are known to affect the state of anxiety and the hippocampus is the main target of glucocorticoids in the brain. Hence, we investigated whether the hippocampal expression of the two classical corticosteroid receptors, mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) differed in the two groups of rats. We found that LA rats displayed higher hippocampal expression of MR but not GR than HA rats. Indeed, the expression levels for these receptors were positively correlated with the amount of time spent by the animals in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Moreover, we present evidence that the levels of anxiety quantified in the first stages of our study constitute a trait rather than a state. Taken together, this study has generated evidence of a close interaction between the anxiety trait, hippocampal MR expression and the learning abilities of individuals in stressful spatial orientation tasks.

All rights reserved.', 'Spatial learning impairment induced by chronic stress is related to individual differences in novelty reactivity: search for neurobiological correlates Although chronic stress has been reported to induce deleterious effects on hippocampal structure and function, the possible existence of individual differences in the vulnerability to develop stress-induced cognitive alterations was hypothetized. This study was designed to evaluate (i) whether individual variability in behavioural reactivity to novelty could be related to a differential vulnerability to show spatial learning deficits after chronic stress in young adult rats, and (ii) to what extent, could individual differences in stress-induced cognitive alterations be related to alterations in specific neurobiological substrates. Four month-old Wistar male rats were classified according to their locomotor reactivity to a novel environment, as either low (LR) or highly (HR) reactive, and then either submitted to psychosocial stress for 21-days (consisting of the daily cohabitation of each young adult rat with a new middle-aged rat) or left undisturbed. The results showed that psychosocial stress induced a marked deficit in spatial learning in the water maze in HR, but not in LR, rats. Then, a second experiment investigated the possible differential expression of corticosteroid receptors (MR and GR) and cell adhesion molecules (NCAM and L1) in the hippocampus of HR and LR rats, both under basal conditions and after exposure to chronic social stress. Although chronic stress induced a reduction on the hippocampal expression of MRs and the NCAM-140 isoform, the levels of these molecules did not differ between stressed rats with and without spatial learning impairments; i.e., between HR- and LR-stressed rats, respectively. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the reduction of the hippocampal expression of NCAM-140 induced by psychosocial stress was particularly marked in HR stressed rats. However, the expression of GRs, NCAM-120 and NCAM-180 isoforms, and L1, was not affected by stress, regardless of the reactivity of the animals. Therefore, although we failed to find a neurobiological substrate that specifically correlated with the differential cognitive vulnerability to chronic stress shown by animals with a different novelty reactivity, this study confirms the hypothesis that rats differ in their susceptibility to display stress-induced impairments in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning tasks. In addition, it provides a model to further search for the neurobiological substrate(s) involved in the differential susceptibility to develop stress-induced cognitive impairments. (C) 2003  Ltd. All rights reserved.', 'Prior exposure to a single stress session facilitates subsequent contextual fear conditioning in rats - Evidence for a role of corticosterone Previous studies showed that exposure of rats to chronic restraint stress for 21 days enhances subsequent contextual fear conditioning. Since recent evidence suggest that this effect is not dependent on stress-induced neurodegenerative processes, but to elevated trainingelicited glucocorticoid release in chronically stressed animals, we aimed to explore here whether a single exposure to restraint stress, which is not expected to induce neuronal damage, would also affect contextual fear conditioning. We also questioned whether post-training corticosterone levels might be associated with any potential effect of stress on fear conditioning. Adult male Wistar rats were exposed to acute restraint stress for 2 h and, two days later, trained in the contextual fear conditioning task, under training conditions involving either moderate (0.4 mA shock) or high (1 mA shock) stress levels. The results showed that acute stress enhanced conditioned freezing at both training conditions, although data from the 1 mA shock intensity experiment only approached significance. Stressed animals were shown to display higher post-training corticosterone levels. Furthermore, the facilitating effect of prior stress was not evident when animals were trained in the hippocampal-independent auditory-cued conditioning task. Therefore, these findings support the idea that stress experiences preceding exposure to new types of stressors facilitate the development of contextual fear conditioning. They also indicate that not only repeated, but also a single exposure to aversive stimulation is sufficient to facilitate context-dependent fear conditioning, and suggest that increased glucocorticoid release at training might be implicated in the mechanisms mediating the memory facilitating effects induced by prior stress experiences.

Herbivore attack can dramatically increase plant volatile emissions in many species. However, plants do not only react to herbivore-inflicted damage, but also already start adjusting their metabolism upon egg deposition by insects. Several studies have found evidence that egg deposition itself can induce the release of volatiles, but little is known about the effects of oviposition on the volatiles released in response to subsequent herbivory. To study this we measured the effect of oviposition by Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) moths on constitutive and herbivore-induced volatiles in maize (Zea mays L.). Results demonstrate that egg deposition reduces the constitutive emission of volatiles and suppresses the typical burst of inducible volatiles following mechanical damage and application of caterpillar regurgitant, a treatment that mimics herbivory. We discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for reducing the plant's signaling capacity triggered by S. frugiperda oviposition and how suppression of volatile organic compounds can influence the interaction between the plant, the herbivore, and other organisms in its environment. Future studies should consider oviposition as a potential modulator of plant responses to insect herbivores."", ""Fungal infection reduces herbivore-induced plant volatiles of maize but does not affect naive parasitoids Plants attacked by insects release volatile compounds that attract the herbivores' natural enemies. This so-called indirect defense is plastic and may be affected by an array of biotic and abiotic factors. We investigated the effect of fungal infection as a biotic stress agent on the emission of herbivore-induced volatiles and the possible consequences for the attraction of two parasitoid species. Maize seedlings that were simultaneously attacked by the fungus Setosphaeria turcica and larvae of Spodoptera littoralis emitted a blend of volatiles that was qualitatively similar to the blend emitted by maize that was damaged by only the herbivore, but there was a clear quantitative difference. When simultaneously challenged by fungus and herbivore, the maize plants emitted in total 47% less of the volatiles. Emissions of green leaf volatiles were unaffected. In a six-arm olfactometer, the parasitoids Cotesia marginiventris and Microplitis rufiventris responded equally well to odors of herbivore-damaged and fungus- and herbivore-damaged maize plants. Healthy and fungus-infected plants were not attractive. An additional experiment showed that the performance of S. littoralis caterpillars was not affected by the presence of the pathogen, nor was there an effect on larvae of M. rufiventris developing inside the caterpillars. Our results confirm previous indications that naive wasps may respond primarily to the green leaf volatiles."", 'The induction of volatile emissions in maize by three herbivore species with different feeding habits: Possible consequences for their natural enemies In order to find their prey natural enemies of herbivores often make effective use of plant volatiles that are emitted by plants on which the herbivores have been feeding. The phenomenon of herbivore-induced emissions of attractants has been well investigated for mite-plant interactions and for interactions between leaf feeding caterpillars and plants. Herbivore-induced emissions of chemical signals appear to be common in plants, but little is known about induction by herbivores that have different feeding habits. We obtained more knowledge on this by comparing the volatile emissions induced in maize plants by a folivorous caterpillar (Spodoptera littoralis), a stemborer (Ostrinia nubilalis), and an aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis). As controls we also measured the emissions of healthy, undamaged plants and plants that were mechanically damaged and then treated with caterpillar regurgitate. Volatiles were collected twice daily for 2 h over a 3-day period after initial infestation or mechanical damage. Quantitatively, the plants infested with S. littoralis emitted by far the most. Their emissions started several hours after initial damage, lasted for the 3 days, and were the highest on the third day. The volatile profile was the same for the regurgitate-treated plants, but here the emissions dropped rapidly after the first day. The plants infested by O. nubilalis emitted the same blend of volatiles, but in much lower quantities, In addition to the known induced maize volatiles, the Ostrinia-damaged plants emitted some highly volatile, still unidentified compounds, which may be specific for the frass of this insect or emitted from the damaged plant stem. The aphids induced no measurable emissions of volatiles in the maize, even after heavy infestation. This is perhaps because several aphids, including R. maidis, barely damage the plant cells, and may not trigger a plant response. These findings suggest that induction of volatiles is the result of cell tissue damage, particularly to the leaves of the plant. This should have consequences also for the search strategies employed by the natural enemies of the respective herbivores, It can be expected that enemies of stemborers use some highly volatile compounds in addition to the known induced compounds. Natural enemies of some aphids may have to resort to other foraging cues, as the plant appears to provide them with no or very little olfactory information.

10,297,10_fishes_evolutionary_fish_phenotypic,"['Male-male competition and speciation: aggression bias towards differently coloured rivals varies between stages of speciation in a Lake Victoria cichlid species complex Sympatric speciation driven by sexual selection by female mate choice on a male trait is a much debated topic. The process is problematic because of the lack of negative frequency-dependent selection that can facilitate the invasion of a novel colour phenotype and stabilize trait polymorphism. It has recently been proposed that male-male competition for mating territories can generate frequency-dependent selection on male colouration. Rare male cichlid fish would enjoy a fitness advantage if territorial defenders bias aggression towards male cichlid fish of their own colour. We used blue (ancestral type) and red phenotypes of the Lake Victoria cichlid species complex Pundamilia. We tested the aggression bias of wild-caught territorial blue male cichlid fish from five separate populations for blue vs. red rival male cichlid fish using simulated intruder choice tests. The different populations vary in the frequency of red male cichlid fish, and in the degree of reproductive isolation between red and blue, reflecting different stages of speciation. Blue male cichlid fish from a population that lack red phenotypes biased aggression towards blue stimulus male cichlid fish. The same was found in two populations where blue and red are reproductively isolated sister species. This aggression bias may facilitate the invasion of a novel colour phenotype and species coexistence. Blue male cichlid fish from two populations where red and blue are hybridizing incipient species biased aggression towards red stimulus male cichlid fish. Thus, after a successful invasion of red, aggression bias alone is not likely to generate frequency dependence required to stabilize the coexistence of phenotypes. The findings show that aggression bias varies between stages of speciation, but is not enough to stabilize the process of speciation.', 'The onset of ecological diversification 50 years after colonization of a crater lake by haplochromine cichlid fishes Adaptive radiation research typically relies on the study of evolution in retrospective, leaving the predictive value of the concept hard to evaluate. Several radiations, including the cichlid fishes in the East African Great Lakes, have been studied extensively, yet no study has investigated the onset of the intraspecific processes of niche expansion and differentiation shortly after colonization of an adaptive zone by cichlids. Haplochromine cichlids of one of the two lineages that seeded the Lake Victoria radiation recently arrived in Lake Chala, a lake perfectly suited for within-lake cichlid speciation. Here, we infer the colonization and demographic history, quantify phenotypic, ecological and genomic diversity and diversification, and investigate the selection regime to ask if the population shows signs of diversification resembling the onset of adaptive radiation. We find that since their arrival in the lake, haplochromines have colonized a wide range of depth habitats associated with ecological and morphological expansion and the beginning of phenotypic differentiation and potentially nascent speciation, consistent with the very early onset of an adaptive radiation process. Moreover, we demonstrate evidence of rugged phenotypic fitness surfaces, indicating that current ecological selection may contribute to the phenotypic diversification.', 'The genomic substrate for adaptive radiation in African cichlid fish Cichlid fishes are famous for large, diverse and replicated adaptive radiations in the Great Lakes of East Africa. To understand themolecular mechanisms underlying cichlid phenotypic diversity, we sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of five lineages of African cichlids: the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), an ancestral lineage with low diversity; and four members of the East African lineage: Neolamprologus brichardi/pulcher (older radiation, Lake Tanganyika), Metriaclima zebra (recent radiation, Lake Malawi), Pundamilia nyererei (very recent radiation, Lake Victoria), and Astatotilapia burtoni (riverine species around Lake Tanganyika). We found an excess of gene duplications in the East African lineage compared to tilapia and other teleosts, an abundance of non-coding element divergence, accelerated coding sequence evolution, expression divergence associated with transposable element insertions, and regulation by novel microRNAs. In addition, we analysed sequence data from sixty individuals representing six closely related species from Lake Victoria, and show genome-wide diversifying selection on coding and regulatory variants, some of which were recruited from ancient polymorphisms. We conclude that a number of molecular mechanisms shaped East African cichlid genomes, and that amassing of standing variation during periods of relaxed purifying selection may have been important in facilitating subsequent evolutionary diversification.']","['fishes', 'evolutionary', 'fish', 'phenotypic', 'species', 'evolution', 'whitefish', 'genetic', 'lakes', 'ecological']",whitefish,Evolution,ichthyology,whitefish,Evolutionary Biology,Fish Evolution,19

Levels of HIV RNA in plasma (HIV-RNA(plasma)) and of unspliced cell-associated HIV-1 RNA (HIV-UsRNA(PBMC)) were significantly increased as a result of STI, whereas no significant shifts in the levels of 2-LTR episomal HIV-1 DNA (2-LTR circles) and total late HIV-1 reverse transcripts (late-DNA) were observed. Thus, limited viral replication had occurred, which had no effect on the pool size of infected cells in the periphery. Levels of 2-LTR circles did not reflect rapid changes in HIV-1 replication.

Alternative strategies, such as large-scale sequencing to identify low frequency variation, should be considered for identifying novel host genetic predictors of HIV-1 acquisition. Methods: We matched couples without HIV-1 seroconversion to those with seroconversion by quantified HIV-1 exposure risk. Logistic regression of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 798 samples from 496 HIV-1 infected and 302 HIV-1 exposed, uninfected individuals was performed to identify factors associated with HIV-1 acquisition.

A central, yet unresolved issue of HIV disease is the mechanism for this loss, and in particular whether HIV-specific CD4(+) T cells are preferentially affected(3-5). Here we show that HIV-specific memory CD4(+) T cells in infected individuals contain more HIV viral DNA than other memory CD4(+) T cells, at all stages of HIV disease. Additionally, following viral rebound during interruption of antiretroviral therapy, the frequency of HIV viral DNA in the HIV-specific pool of memory CD4(+) T cells increases to a greater extent than in memory CD4(+) T cells of other specificities. These findings show that HIV-specific CD4(+) T cells are preferentially infected by HIV in vivo. This provides a potential mechanism to explain the loss of HIV-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses, and consequently the loss of immunological control of HIV replication(6). Furthermore, the phenomenon of HIV specifically infecting the very cells that respond to it adds a cautionary note to the practice of structured therapy interruption.']","['hiv', 'aids', 'antiretroviral', 'virus', 'viral', 'genome', 'immunodeficiency', 'infected', 'immune', 'genetic']",hiv,HIV/AIDS,HIV,hiv,HIV/AIDS Research,HIV/AIDS Biology,19
12,293,12_oogenesis_embryogenesis_morphogenesis_mutants,"['Dpp controls growth and patterning in Drosophila wing precursors through distinct modes of action Dpp, a member of the BMP family, is a morphogen that specifies positional information in Drosophila wing precursors. In this tissue, Dpp expressed along the anterior-posterior boundary forms a concentration gradient that controls the expression domains of target genes, which in turn specify the position of wing veins. Dpp also promotes growth in this tissue. The relationship between the spatio-temporal profile of Dpp signalling and growth has been the subject of debate, which has intensified recently with the suggestion that the stripe of Dpp is dispensable for growth. With two independent conditional alleles of dpp, we find that the stripe of Dpp is essential for wing growth. We then show that this requirement, but not patterning, can be fulfilled by uniform, low level, Dpp expression. Thus, the stripe of Dpp ensures that signalling remains above a pro-growth threshold, while at the same time generating a gradient that patterns cell fates.', 'Regulation of the embryonic cell proliferation by Drosophila cyclin D and cyclin E complexes Cell proliferation during Drosophila development occurs in a well known spatial and temporal pattern which can readily be studied in viva. The cells which form the larval epidermis exit from the cell division cycle during embryogenesis after the 16th round of mitosis when they enter for the first time into a G1/0 phase. We are interested in the mechanistic basis of this cell proliferation arrest. We have shown that the arrest requires the down-regulation of cyclin E/Cdk2 activity by inhibition of cyclin E expression and parallel activation of Dacapo/p27 expression. In addition, up-regulation of Fizzy-related is observed and is required for inhibition of Cdk1 activity. Do these processes result from the down-regulation of D-type cyclin/Cdk complexes? Extensive evidence from mammalian cells, and in particular from tumour cells has suggested that these complexes act as master regulators of cell proliferation upstream of cyclin E. Our genetic analyses indicate that Drosophila cyclin D/Cdk4, which interacts with the Drosophila Rb family member as expected, does not play an essential role in the regulation of cell proliferation.', 'DPP controls tracheal cell migration along the dorsoventral body axis of the Drosophila embryo We report that DPP signaling is required for directed tracheal cell migration during Drosophila embryogenesis. The failure of tracheal cells to receive the DPP signal from adjacent dorsal and ventral cells results in the absence of dorsal and ventral migrations. Ectopic DPP signaling can reprogram cells in the center of the placode to adopt a dorsoventral migration behavior. The effects observed in response to ectopic DPP signaling are also observed upon the tracheal-specific expression of a constitutive active DPP type I receptor (TKVQ253D), indicating that the DPP signal is received and transmitted in tracheal cells to control their migration behavior, DPP signaling determines localized gene expression patterns in the developing tracheal placode, and is also required for the dorsal expression of the recently identified BRANCHLESS (BNL) guidance molecule, the ligand of the BREATHLESS (BTL) receptor. Thus, DPP plays a dual role during tracheal cell migration, It is required to control the dorsal expression of the BNL ligand; in addition, the DPP signal recruits groups of dorsal and ventral tracheal cells and programs them to migrate in dorsal and ventral directions.']","['oogenesis', 'embryogenesis', 'morphogenesis', 'mutants', 'proliferation', 'mutant', 'cells', 'genes', 'gene', 'embryos']",embryogenesis,Development,Development,embryogenesis,Developmental Biology,Developmental Biology,19

The physiological mechanisms that affect the course of such social interactions are little understood. In the cleaning mutualism, cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus do not always act cooperatively by eating ectoparasites, but sometimes cheat by taking bites of mucus from so-called ""client"" reef fish. The physiological mechanisms in these interspecific interactions, however, are little studied. Here, we focussed on three neuromodulator systems known to play important roles in intraspecific social behaviour of vertebrates to examine their role in clients\' interspecific behaviour. We subjected the client fish Scolopsis bilineatus to ectoparasites and the exogenous manipulation of the vasotocin (AVT), isotocin (IT) and serotonin systems to test how this affects client willingness to seek cleaning and client aggression towards cleaners. We found that a single dose of AVT agonist and a selective antagonist caused clients to seek proximity to cleaners, independently of ectoparasite infection. In contrast, in a direct encounter task, the selective blocker of serotonin 5HT(2A/2c) receptors, Ketanserin (MET), made client reef fish more aggressive towards cleaners in the absence of cleaners\' bites of mucus. IT did not yield any significant effects. Our results suggest that the AVT system plays a role in social affiliation towards an interspecific partner, while the serotonin system affects clients\' acceptance of level of proximity to cleaner fish during interactions. These two systems, therefore, were apparently co-opted from intraspecific social interactions to affect the course of interspecific ones also.

This contrasts strongly with our lack of knowledge on proximate causes of cooperative behaviour. Marine cleaning mutualism has been used as a model system to address functional aspects of conflict resolution: client reef fish benefit from cleaning interactions through parasite removal, but cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus prefer client mucus. Hence, feeding against their preference represents cooperative behaviour in cleaners. Cleaners regularly cheat non-predatory clients while they rarely cheat predatory clients. Here, we asked how precisely cleaners can adjust service quality from one interaction to the next. We found that non-predatory clients receive a better service if the previous client was a predator than if the previous client was a non-predator. In a related laboratory experiment, a hand-net used as a stressor resulted in cleaners feeding more against their preference in subsequent interactions. The combination of the cleaners' behaviour in the two studies shows that the cleaners' service quality for a given client species is not fixed, but it can be manipulated. The results suggest that short-term stress is one factor that causes cleaners to increase their levels of cooperation, a hypothesis that is amenable to further experiments manipulating the endocrine system."", 'Punishment and partner switching cause cooperative behaviour in a cleaning mutualism What are the mechanisms that prevent partners from cheating in potentially cooperative interactions between unrelated individuals? The cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus and client reef fish both benefit from an interaction as long as the cleaner eats ectoparasites. However, the cleaner fish prefers some client mucus, which constitutes cheating. Field observations suggested that clients control such cheating by using punishment (chasing the cleaner) or by switching partners (fleeing from the cleaner). Here, we tested experimentally whether such client behaviours result in cooperative cleaner fish. Cleaners were allowed to feed from Plexiglas plates containing prawn items and fish flake items. A lever attached to the plates allowed us to mimic the behaviours of clients. As cleaners showed a strong preference for prawn over flakes, we taught them that eating their preferred food would cause the plate to either chase them or to flee, while feeding on flakes had no negative consequences. We found a significant shift in cleaner fish foraging behaviour towards flake feeding after six learning trials. As punishment and terminating an interaction resulted in the cleaners feeding against their preferences in our experiment, we propose that the same behaviours in clients improve the service quality of cleaners under natural conditions.']","['interactions', 'fish', 'relatedness', 'behaviours', 'cooperation', 'predators', 'behavioural', 'social', 'predator', 'cooperative']",fish,Cooperation,Behaviour,fish,Fish Interactions,Social Behaviors in Fish,19

That mosquitoes rarely melanize Plasmodium falciparum in natural populations might result from immuno-suppression by the parasite, as has been observed in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected by Plasmodium gallinaceum. We tested this possibility in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes infected by P. falciparum by comparing the ability to melanize a Sephadex bead of infected mosquitoes, of mosquitoes that had fed on infectious blood without becoming infected, and of control mosquitoes fed on uninfected blood. Rather than being immuno-suppressed, infected mosquitoes tended to have a stronger melanization response than mosquitoes in which the infection failed and than control mosquitoes, possibly because of immune activation after previous exposure to invading parasites. This finding suggests that P. falciparum relies on immune evasion rather than immuno-suppression to avoid being melanized and confirms that natural malaria transmission systems differ from laboratory models of mosquito-Plasmodium interactions.', ""Resisting infection by Plasmodium berghei increases the sensitivity of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae to DDT Results: Sensitivity to DDT increased with the mosquitoes' age and was higher in mosquitoes that had fed on Plasmodium-infected mice than in those that had not been exposed to the parasite. The latter effect was mainly due to the high sensitivity of mosquitoes that had fed on an infected mouse but were not themselves infected, while the sensitivity to DDT was only slightly higher in mosquitoes infected by Plasmodium than in those that had fed on an uninfected mouse. Methods: DDT-resistant Anopheles gambiae (ZANU) mosquitoes received a blood meal from either a mouse infected with Plasmodium berghei or an uninfected mouse. 10 and 19 days post blood meal the mosquitoes were exposed to 2%, 1% or 0% DDT using WHO test kits. 24 hrs after exposure, mortality and Plasmodium infection status of the mosquitoes were recorded. Conclusions: The observed pattern indicates a cost of parasite-resistance. It suggests that, in addition to the detrimental effect of insecticide-resistance on control, the continued use of insecticides in a population of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes could select mosquitoes to be more susceptible to Plasmodium infection, thus further decreasing the efficacy of the control. Background: The evolution of insecticide resistance threatens current malaria control methods, which rely heavily on chemical insecticides. The magnitude of the threat will be determined by the phenotypic expression of resistance in those mosquitoes that can transmit malaria. These differ from the majority of the mosquito population in two main ways; they carry sporozoites (the infectious stage of the Plasmodium parasite) and they are relatively old, as they need to survive the development period of the malaria parasite. This study examines the effects of infection by Plasmodium berghei and of mosquito age on the sensitivity to DDT in a DDT-resistant strain of Anopheles gambiae."", 'Rodent malaria-resistant strains of the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, have slower population growth than -susceptible strains Results: We used matrix population models to compare the population growth rates among lines of Anopheles gambiae that had been selected for resistance or high susceptibility to the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis. The population growth rate of the resistant line was significantly lower than that of the highly susceptible and the unselected control lines, regardless of whether mosquitoes were infected with Plasmodium or not. The lower population growth of malaria-resistant mosquitoes was caused by reduced post blood-feeding survival of females and poor egg hatching. Conclusion: With respect to eradicating malaria, the strategy of releasing Plasmodium-resistant Anopheles mosquitoes is unlikely to be successful if the costs of Plasmodium-resistance in the field are as great as the ones measured in this study. High densities of malaria-resistant mosquitoes would have to be maintained by continuous release from captive breeding facilities. Background: Trade-offs between anti-parasite defence mechanisms and other life history traits limit the evolution of host resistance to parasites and have important implications for understanding diseases such as malaria. Mosquitoes have not evolved complete resistance to malaria parasites and one hypothesis is that anti-malaria defence mechanisms are costly.']","['malarial', 'malaria', 'mosquito', 'mosquitoes', 'antimalarial', 'plasmodium', 'parasite', 'parasites', 'anopheles', 'immune']",malaria,Malaria,Malaria,malaria,Malaria Research,Malaria and Mosquitoes,19

We discover extremely widespread genetic variation affecting the regulation of most genes, with transcript structure and expression level variation being equally common but genetically largely independent. Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci. Altogether, this study provides a deep understanding of the cellular mechanisms of transcriptome variation and of the landscape of functional variants in the human genome.', 'Rare and Common Regulatory Variation in Population-Scale Sequenced Human Genomes Population-scale genome sequencing allows the characterization of functional effects of a broad spectrum of genetic variants underlying human phenotypic variation. Here, we investigate the influence of rare and common genetic variants on gene expression patterns, using variants identified from sequencing data from the 1000 genomes project in an African and European population sample and gene expression data from lymphoblastoid cell lines. We detect comparable numbers of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) when compared to genotypes obtained from HapMap 3, but as many as 80% of the top expression quantitative trait variants (eQTVs) discovered from 1000 genomes data are novel. The properties of the newly discovered variants suggest that mapping common causal regulatory variants is challenging even with full resequencing data; however, we observe significant enrichment of regulatory effects in splice-site and nonsense variants. Using RNA sequencing data, we show that 46.2% of nonsynonymous variants are differentially expressed in at least one individual in our sample, creating widespread potential for interactions between functional protein-coding and regulatory variants. We also use allele-specific expression to identify putative rare causal regulatory variants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that outlier expression values can be due to rare variant effects, and we approximate the number of such effects harboured in an individual by effect size. Our results demonstrate that integration of genomic and RNA sequencing analyses allows for the joint assessment of genome sequence and genome function.', 'Modifier Effects between Regulatory and Protein-Coding Variation Genome-wide associations have shown a lot of promise in dissecting the genetics of complex traits in humans with single variants, yet a large fraction of the genetic effects is still unaccounted for. Analyzing genetic interactions between variants (epistasis) is one of the potential ways forward. We investigated the abundance and functional impact of a specific type of epistasis, namely the interaction between regulatory and protein-coding variants. Using genotype and gene expression data from the 210 unrelated individuals of the original four HapMap populations, we have explored the combined effects of regulatory and protein-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We predict that about 18% (1,502 out of 8,233 nsSNPs) of protein-coding variants are differentially expressed among individuals and demonstrate that regulatory variants can modify the functional effect of a coding variant in cis. Furthermore, we show that such interactions in cis can affect the expression of downstream targets of the gene containing the protein- coding SNP. In this way, a cis interaction between regulatory and protein- coding variants has a trans impact on gene expression. Given the abundance of both types of variants in human populations, we propose that joint consideration of regulatory and protein- coding variants may reveal additional genetic effects underlying complex traits and disease and may shed light on causes of differential penetrance of known disease variants.']","['genomic', 'genes', 'genotype', 'phenotypes', 'gene', 'genetic', 'genomes', 'genome', 'mutation', 'sequencing']",gene,Genomics,Genetics,gene,Genomics,Genetic Sequencing,19

Our group previously demonstrated that MET inhibition in tumor cells with deregulated MET activity results in radiosensitization via downregulation of the ATR-CHK1-CDC25 pathway, a major signaling cascade responsible for intra-S and G(2)-M cell-cycle arrest following DNA damage. Here we aimed at studying the potential therapeutic application of ionizing radiation in combination with a MET inhibitor, EMD-1214063, in p53-deficient cancer cells that harbor impaired G(1)-S checkpoint regulation upon DNA damage. We hypothesized that upon MET inhibition, p53-deficient cells would bypass both G(1)-S and G(2)-M checkpoints, promoting premature mitotic entry with substantial DNA lesions and cell death in a greater extent than p53-proficient cells. Our data suggest that p53-deficient cells are more susceptible to EMD-1214063 and combined treatment with irradiation than wild-type p53 lines as inferred from elevated gamma H2AX expression and increased cytotoxicity. Furthermore, cell-cycle distribution profiling indicates constantly lower G(1) and higher G(2)-M population as well as higher expression of a mitotic marker p-histone H3 following the dual treatment in p53 knockdown isogenic variant, compared with the parental counterpart.

Although it was previously classified as an oncoprotein, p53 has emerged as a tumor suppressor controlling cell cycle progression by regulating gene transcription. A major biochemical property of wild-type p53 is its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. The human c-H-ras gene contains within its first intron sequences that partially match the p53 consensus binding site. We determined that these sequences represent a bona fide p53 element, since in vitro translated wild-type p53 recognized them with high affinity. Furthermore, wild-type p53 activated transcription from a reporter plasmid containing the c-H-ras element as an enhancer. These findings suggest that p53 regulates cellular growth by coordinate transcription of genes that suppress and promote cellular proliferation.', 'Aberrant regulation and function of wild-type p53 in radioresistant melanoma cells Sporadic human tumors and the hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome Li-Fraumeni are frequently associated with mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene that compromise its ability to function as a DNA damage checkpoint. A subset of Li-Fraumeni patients with wild-type p53 alleles have mutations in chk2/hcds1, one of the genes signaling the presence of DNA damage to the p53 protein. This suggests that p53 may be kept inactive in human cancer by mutations targeting DNA damage signaling pathways. Melanoma cells are highly radioresistant, yet they express wild-type p53 protein, raising the possibility of defects in the pathways that activate p53 in response to DNA damage. We have described a chk2/hcds1-independent DNA damage signaling pathway that targets Ser-376 within the COOH terminus of p53 for dephosphorylation and leads to increased p53 functional activity, We now report that in several human melanoma cell lines that express wild-type p53, the phosphorylation state of Ser-376 was not regulated by DNA damage. In these cell lines, neither the endogenous wild-type p53 protein nor high levels of ectopic wild-type p53 led to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, Thus, defective activation of p53 in response to DNA damage may underlie the radioresistance of human melanoma cells.']","['p53', 'carcinoma', 'cancer', 'carcinomas', 'p73', 'tumors', 'tumor', 'tumour', 'kinase', 'melanoma']",cancer,Oncology,cancer,cancer,Tumor Suppression,Cancer Biology,19

It has been proposed that procyclins protect parasites against proteases and/or participate in tropism, directing them from the midgut to the salivary glands. There are four different procyclin genes, each subject to elaborate levels of regulation. To determine if procyclins are essential for survival and transmission of T. brucei, all four genes were deleted and parasite fitness was compared in vitro and in vivo. When co-cultured in vitro, the null mutant and wild type trypanosomes (tagged with cyan fluorescent protein) maintained a near-constant equilibrium. In contrast, when flies were infected with the same mixture, the null mutant was rapidly overgrown in the midgut, reflecting a reduction in fitness in vivo. Although the null mutant is patently defective in competition with procyclin-positive parasites, on its own it can complete the life cycle and generate infectious metacyclic forms. The procyclic form of T. brucei thus differs strikingly from the bloodstream form, which does not tolerate any perturbation of its variant surface glycoprotein coat, and from other parasites such as Plasmodium berghei, which requires the circumsporozoite protein for successful transmission to a new host.', 'BIOCHEMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION OF HISTONE H1-LIKE PROTEINS IN PROCYCLIC TRYPANOSOMA-BRUCEI-BRUCEI Four variants and/or posttranslational modifications of histone H1-like proteins of Trypanosoma brucei brucei procyclic culture forms were extracted with 0.25 N HCl from isolated nuclei and analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The amino acid composition of these proteins, their ability to space nucleosomes regularly and to induce salt-dependent condensation of the chromatin indicated their histone H1 nature. On the other hand, the histone H1-like proteins clearly differed from their higher-eukaryote counterparts by their weak interaction with DNA under low-salt conditions. As a consequence, intact nucleosome filaments were prepared according to a new preparation protocol especially adapted to the unstable chromatin of T. b. brucei. Our results indicate that the biochemical properties of the histone H1-like proteins contribute to the structural and functional differences between the chromatin of procyclic T. b. brucei and that of higher eukaryotes.', 'TRYPANOSOMA-BRUCEI-BRUCEI - DIFFERENCES IN THE NUCLEAR CHROMATIN OF BLOOD-STREAM FORMS AND PROCYCLIC CULTURE FORMS Nucleosome filaments of two stages of the life-cycle of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, namely bloodstream forms and procyclic culture forms, were investigated by electron microscopy. Chromatin of bloodstream forms showed a salt-dependent condensation. The level of condensation was higher than that shown by chromatin from procyclic culture forms, but 30 nm fibres as formed in rat liver chromatin preparations were not found. Analysis of histones provided new evidence for the existence of H1-like proteins, which comigrated in the region of the core histones in SDS-PAGE and in front of the core histones in Triton acid urea gels. Differences were found between the H1-like proteins of the two trypanosome stages as well as between the core histones in their amount, number of bands and banding pattern. It can be concluded that T. b. brucei contains a full set of histones, including H1-like proteins, and that the poor condensation of its chromatin is not due to the absence of H1, but most probably due to histone-DNA interaction being weak. It is obvious that structural and functional differences of the chromatin exist not only between T. b. brucei and higher eukaryotes, but also between various stages of the life-cycle of the parasite. It is therefore not adequate to investigate the chromatin only of the procyclic culture forms as a model for all stages of the life-cycle of T. b. brucei.']","['trypanosomes', 'trypanosoma', 'trypanosomal', 'trypanosomiasis', 'trypanosome', 'parasites', 'parasite', 'chromatin', 'proteins', 'neutrophils']",trypanosome,Trypanosomes,Trypanosomiasis,trypanosome,Trypanosomiasis Research,Trypanosome Parasites,19

We investigated the genetics of this host-pathogen interaction by using phenotyping and PCR assays to detect genes in both wheat and powdery mildew, which are known determinants of the outcome of these interactions (resistance or susceptibility). The mildew genes increase or decrease the pathogen virulence, while the wheat genes provide specific immunity against the mildew isolates expressing the corresponding avirulence genes. Here, we describe the experiments performed to understand the genetic basis of race-specific resistance of wheat to powdery mildew, which is part of the course 'Mechanisms of Plant Disease Resistance against Fungal Pathogens' designed for advanced third-year students of biology at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. In this course, students learn how plants and their pathogenic fungi engage in an arms race against each other to survive."", 'Rapid generation of new powdery mildew resistance genes after wheat domestication Plant defence against pathogens is controlled by disease resistance (R) gene products that directly or indirectly detect specific pathogen effectors. Plant-pathogen interactions have been proposed to follow a co-evolutionary arms-race model where R genes are recent and evolve rapidly in response to structural changes in matching pathogen effectors. However, the longevity and extensive polymorphism of R genes studied were more consistent with balancing selection maintaining ancient and diverse R genes or alleles. In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), the Pm3 locus confers race-specific resistance to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. triticii). Here we describe recently generated Pm3 resistance alleles that all derive from one susceptible allele, Pm3CS, which is widespread among hexaploid bread-wheat lines. One group of four Pm3 resistance alleles shows few, clearly delimited, polymorphic sequence blocks of ancient origin, embedded in sequences identical to Pm3CS and possibly derived from gene conversion. A second group of three alleles differs from Pm3CS by only two to five mutations, all non-synonymous, and all in the leucine-rich repeat-encoding region. Transient transformation experiments confirmed that Pm3 resistance specificities are based on one or few amino acid changes. The Pm3CS allele was found in wild tetraploid wheat, the ancestor of hexaploid bread wheat, specifically from southern Turkey, a region proposed to be the site of wheat domestication. Based on these data, we propose that the Pm3 resistance alleles were generated in agricultural ecosystems after domestication of wheat 10 000 years ago. The evolution of Pm3 alleles in wheat is best described by the model of evolved recycling, where novel genetic variation is integrated in plant populations together with recycling of old variation.', 'Genome analysis at different ploidy levels allows cloning of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3b from hexaploid wheat In wheat, race-specific resistance to the fungal pathogen powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) is controlled by the Pm genes.

The genome of hexaploid wheat has a size of 1.6 x 10(10) bp and contains more than 80% of repetitive sequences, making positional cloning difficult. Here, we demonstrate that the combined analysis of genomes from wheat species with different ploidy levels can be exploited for positional cloning in bread wheat. We have mapped the Pm3b gene in hexaploid wheat to a genetic interval of 0.97 centimorgan (cM). The diploid T. monococcum and the tetraploid T. turgidum ssp. durum provided models for the A genome of hexaploid wheat and allowed to establish a physical contig spanning the Pm3 locus. Although the haplotypes at the Pm3 locus differed markedly between the three species, a large resistance gene-like family specific to wheat group 1 chromosomes was consistently found at the Pm3 locus. A candidate gene for Pm3b was identified using partial sequence conservation between resistant line Chul and T. monococcum cv. DV92. A susceptible Pm3b mutant, carrying a single-base pair deletion in the coding region of the candidate gene was isolated. When tested in a single cell transformation assay, the Pm3b candidate gene conferred race-specific resistance to powdery mildew.

It has been unclear whether the same pathogenetic mechanisms trigger Salmonella serovar Typhimurium colitis in GF and StrSPF mice. In this study, we compared the two colitis models. In both of the models Salmonella serovar Typhimurium efficiently colonized the large intestine and triggered cecum and colon inflammation starting 8 h postinfection. The type III secretion system encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island I was essential in both disease models. Thus, Salmonella serovar Typhimurium colitis is triggered by similar pathogenetic mechanisms in StrSPF and GF mice. This is remarkable considering the distinct physiological properties of the GF mouse gut. One obvious difference was more pronounced damage and reduced regenerative response of the cecal epithelium in GF mice. Overall, StrSPF mice and GF mice provide similar but not identical models for Salmonella serovar Typhimurium colitis.', 'Salmonella-Induced Mucosal Lectin RegIII beta Kills Competing Gut Microbiota Intestinal inflammation induces alterations of the gut microbiota and promotes overgrowth of the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica by largely unknown mechanisms. Here, we identified a host factor involved in this process. Specifically, the C-type lectin RegIII beta is strongly upregulated during mucosal infection and released into the gut lumen. In vitro, RegIII beta kills diverse commensal gut bacteria but not Salmonella enterica subspecies I serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). Protection of the pathogen was attributable to its specific cell envelope structure. Co-infection experiments with an avirulent S. Typhimurium mutant and a RegIII beta-sensitive commensal E. coli strain demonstrated that feeding of RegIII beta was sufficient for suppressing commensals in the absence of all other changes inflicted by mucosal disease. These data suggest that RegIII beta production by the host can promote S. Typhimurium infection by eliminating inhibitory gut microbiota.', 'Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium exploits inflammation to compete with the intestinal microbiota Most mucosal surfaces of the mammalian body are colonized by microbial communities (""microbiota\'\'). A high density of commensal microbiota inhabits the intestine and shields from infection (""colonization resistance\'\'). The virulence strategies allowing enteropathogenic bacteria to successfully compete with the microbiota and overcome colonization resistance are poorly understood. Here, we investigated manipulation of the intestinal microbiota by the enteropathogenic bacterium Salmonella enterica subspecies 1 serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) in a mouse colitis model: we found that inflammatory host responses induced by S. Tm changed microbiota composition and suppressed its growth. In contrast to wild-type S. Tm, an avirulent invGsseD mutant failing to trigger colitis was outcompeted by the microbiota. This competitive defect was reverted if inflammation was provided concomitantly by mixed infection with wild-type S. Tm or in mice (IL10-/-, VILLIN-HA(CL4-CD8)) with inflammatory bowel disease. Thus, inflammation is necessary and sufficient for overcoming colonization resistance. This reveals a new concept in infectious disease: in contrast to current thinking, inflammation is not always detrimental for the pathogen. Triggering the host\'s immune defence can shift the balance between the protective microbiota and the pathogen in favour of the pathogen.']","['salmonella', 'coli', 'bacterial', 'bacteria', 'microbiota', 'pathogens', 'pathogen', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'colitis']",colitis,Microbiota,Microbiology,colitis,Microbial Pathogens,Bacterial Pathogens,19

The DNA damage signal is transmitted to the checkpoint machinery by a network of specialized DNA damage-recognizing and signal-transducing molecules. However, recent evidence suggests that DNA repair proteins themselves may also directly contribute to the checkpoint control. Here, we investigated the role of homologous recombination (HR) proteins in normal cell cycle regulation in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. For this purpose, we used Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells expressing the Fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicators (Fucci). Systematic siRNA-mediated knockdown of HR genes in these cells demonstrated that the lack of several of these factors alters cell cycle distribution, albeit differentially. The knock-down of MDC1, Rad51 and Brca1 caused the cells to arrest in the G2 phase, suggesting that they may be required for the G2/M transition. In contrast, inhibition of the other HR factors, including several Rad51 paralogs and Rad50, led to the arrest in the G1/G0 phase. Moreover, reduced expression of Rad51B, Rad51C, CtIP and Rad50 induced entry into a quiescent G0-like phase. In conclusion, the lack of many HR factors may lead to cell cycle checkpoint activation, even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, indicating that these proteins may play an essential role both in DNA repair and checkpoint signaling.', ""Mismatch repair-dependent processing of methylation damage gives rise to persistent single-stranded gaps in newly replicated DNA O-6-Methylguanine ((Me)G) is a highly cytotoxic DNA modification generated by S(N)1-type methylating agents. Despite numerous studies implicating DNA replication, mismatch repair (MMR), and homologous recombination (HR) in (Me)G toxicity, its mode of action has remained elusive. We studied the molecular transactions in the DNA of yeast and mammalian cells treated with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Although replication fork progression was unaffected in the first cell cycle after treatment, electron microscopic analysis revealed an accumulation of (Me)G-and MMR-dependent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps in newly replicated DNA. Progression into the second cell cycle required HR, while the following G(2) arrest required the continued presence of (Me)G. Yeast cells overcame this block, while mammalian cells generally failed to recover, and those that did contained multiple sister chromatid exchanges. Notably, the arrest could be abolished by removal of (Me)G after the first S phase. These new data provide compelling support for the hypothesis that MMR attempts to correct (Me)G/C or (Me)G/T mispairs arising during replication. Due to the persistence of (Me)G in the exposed template strand, repair synthesis cannot take place, which leaves single-stranded gaps behind the replication fork. During the subsequent S phase, these gaps cause replication fork collapse and elicit recombination and cell cycle arrest."", 'Postreplicative Mismatch Repair The mismatch repair (MMR) system detects non-Watson-Crick base pairs and strand misalignments arising during DNA replication and mediates their removal by catalyzing excision of the mispair-containing tract of nascent DNA and its error-free resynthesis. In this way, MMR improves the fidelity of replication by several orders of magnitude. It also addresses mispairs and strand misalignments arising during recombination and prevents synapses between nonidentical DNA sequences. Unsurprisingly, MMR malfunction brings about genomic instability that leads to cancer in mammals. But MMR proteins have recently been implicated also in other processes of DNA metabolism, such as DNA damage signaling, antibody diversification, and repair of interstrand cross-links and oxidative DNA damage, in which their functions remain to be elucidated.

In experimental endocarditis, however, Q-D was less efficacious against MRSA isolates constitutively resistant to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogram B (C-MLSB) than against MLSB-susceptible isolates. To circumvent this problem, we used the checkerboard method to screen drug combinations that would increase the efficacy of Q-D against such bacteria, beta-Lactams consistently exhibited additive or synergistic activity with Q-D, Glycopeptides, quinolones, and aminoglycosides were indifferent. No drugs were antagonistic. The positive Q-D-beta-lactam interaction was independent of MLSB or beta-lactam resistance, Moreover, addition of Q-D at one-fourth the MIC to flucloxacillin-containing plates decreased the flucloxacillin MIC for MRSA from 500 to 1,000 mg/liter to 30 to 60 mg/liter, Yet, Q-D-beta-lactam combinations mere not synergistic in bactericidal tests.

Community-acquired MRSA strains have epidemic potential and can be particularly virulent. Vancomycin has been the standard hospital treatment for the past 40 years, but vancomycin-resistant isolates of S. aureus have emerged in the USA, and vancomycin-intermediate isolates are increasingly being reported worldwide. New antimicrobial agents with activity against multidrug-resistant S. aureus and other resistant pathogens are urgently needed. Despite great strides, further advances in our understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms responsible for antimicrobial resistance are still required. Several agents have been recently approved for the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections, including linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline. The novel investigational cephalosporin, ceftobiprole, is one of the first penicillinase-resistant agents to target penicillin-binding protein 2a (or PBP2a), an acquired PBP with low beta-lactam-affinity that confers intrinsic beta-lactam resistance to S. aureus and other staphylococci. This mechanism of PBP binding, including inhibition of PBP2a, confers broad-spectrum activity against clinically important Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA.

Here, we tested whether differences in the rate of acceptance of new queens by resident workers could be a proximate cause explaining the coexistence of single- and multiple-queen colonies in an ant population. We found that Formica selysi workers discriminated against foreign (non-nestmate) queens, which contributes to maintaining the genetic integrity of the social group essential to kin selection. All the young and newly mated foreign queens introduced into experimental groups of workers died within 48 h. In contrast, workers frequently accepted young newly mated nestmate queens. The survival of nestmate queens was not significantly lower in groups of workers originating from single- queen colonies than in groups of workers originating from multiple-queen colonies. Finally, virgin queens had significantly higher survival than mated queens. Together, these results show that the maintenance of single-queen and multiple-queen colonies in the same population is unlikely to be caused by strong differences between the two types of colonies in their rate of acceptance of new queens by workers. They also suggest that the discrimination of queens by resident workers restricts the dispersal of foreign queens among colonies, but not the acceptance of additional nestmate queens.

All rights reserved.', 'Experimental manipulation of queen number affects colony sex ratio investment in the highly polygynous ant Formica exsecta In polygynous (multiple queens per nest) ants, queen dispersal is often limited with young queens being recruited within the parental colony. This mode of dispersal leads to local resource competition between nestmate queens and is frequently associated with extremely male-biased sex ratios at the population level. The queen-replenishment hypothesis has been recently proposed to explain colony sex ratio investment under such conditions. It predicts that colonies containing many queens (subject to high local resource competition) should only produce males, whereas colonies hosting few queens (reduced or no local resource competition) should produce new queens in addition to males. We experimentally tested this hypothesis in the ant Formica exsecta by manipulating queen number over three consecutive years in 120 colonies of a highly polygynous population. Queens were transferred from 40 colonies into another 40 colonies while queen number was not manipulated in 40 control colonies. Genetic analyses of worker offspring revealed that our treatment significantly changed the number of reproductive queens. The sex ratio of colonies was significantly different between treatments in the third breeding season following the experiment initiation. We found that, as predicted by the queen-replenishment hypothesis, queen removal resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of colonies that produced new queens. These results provide the first experimental evidence for the queen-replenishment hypothesis, which might account for sex ratio specialization in many highly polygynous ant species.', 'Flexible colony-founding strategies in a socially polymorphic ant In social insects the number of queens per nest varies greatly. One of the proximate causes of this variation may be that queens produced by multiple-queen colonies are generally smaller, and might thus be unable to found new colonies independently. We examined whether the social origin of queens and males influenced the colony-founding success of queens in the socially polymorphic ant Formica selysi. Queens originating from single-queen and multiple-queen colonies had similar survival rates and colony-founding success, be they alone or in two-queen associations. During the first 5 months, queens originating from single-queen colonies gave rise to more workers than queens originating from multiple-queen colonies. Pairs of queens were also more productive than single queens. However, these differences in productivity were transient, as all types of colonies had reached a similar size after 15 months. Mating between social forms was possible and did not decrease queen survival or colony productivity, compared to mating within social forms. Overall, these results indicate that queens from each social form are able to found colonies independently, at least under laboratory conditions. Moreover, gene flow between social forms is not restricted by mating or genetic incompatibilities. This flexibility in mating and colony founding helps to explain the maintenance of alternative social structures in sympatry and the absence of genetic differentiation between social forms.

This information is necessary to constrain how lacustrine methane production, oxidation and emissions are expected to respond to global change drivers. Several of the available proxies for reconstructing methane cycle changes of lakes rely on interpreting past changes in the abundance or relevance of methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB), either directly (e.g. via analysis of bacterial lipids) or indirectly (e.g. via reconstructions of the past relevance of MOB in invertebrate diet). However, only limited information is available about the extent to which, at the ecosystem scale, variations in abundance and availability of MOB reflect past changes in in-lake methane concentrations. We present a study examining the abundances of fatty acids (FAs), particularly of C-13-depleted FM known to be produced by MOB, relative to methane concentrations in 29 small European lakes. 39 surface sediment samples were obtained from these lakes and FA abundances were compared with methane concentrations measured at the lake surface, 10 cm above the sediments and 10 cm within the sediments. Three of the FAs in the surface sediment samples, C-16(:1 omega 7c), C-16(:1 omega 5c/t), and C-18(:1 omega 7c) were characterized by lower delta C-13 values than the remaining FAs. We show that abundances of these FM, relative to other short-chain FAs produced in lake ecosystems, are related with sedimentary MOB concentrations assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We observed positive relationships between methane concentrations and relative abundances of C-16:1 omega 7c, C-16:1 omega 5c/t, and C-18:1 omega 7c and the sum of these FAs. For the full dataset these relationships were relatively weak (Spearman's rank correlation (r(s)) of 0.34-0.43) and not significant if corrected for multiple testing. However, noticeably stronger and statistically significant relationships were observed when sediments from near-shore and deep-water oxic environments (r(s) = 0.57 to 0.62) and those from anoxic deep-water environment (r(s)= 0.55 to 0.65) were examined separately. Our results confirm that robust relationships exist between in-lake CH 4 concentrations and 13 C-depleted groups of FAs in the examined sediments, agreeing with earlier suggestions that the availability of MOB-derived, C-13-depleted organic matter for aquatic invertebrates increases with increasing methane concentrations. However, we also show that these relationships are complex, with different relationships observed for oxic and anoxic sediments and highest values measured in sediments deposited in oxic environments overlain with relatively methane-rich water. Furthermore, although all three C-13-depleted FA groups identified in our survey are known to be produced by MOB, they also receive contributions by other organism groups, and this will have influenced their distribution in our dataset.

Excessive anthropogenic N fertilizer usage threatens sensitive downstream aquatic ecosystems. Although freshwater lake sediments remove N through various microbially mediated processes, few studies have investigated the microbial communities involved. In an integrated biogeochemical and microbiological study on a eutrophic and oligotrophic lake, we estimated N removal rates from pore water concentration gradients in sediments. Simultaneously, the abundance of different microbial N transformation genes was investigated using metagenomics on a seasonal and spatial scale. We observed that contrasting nutrient concentrations in sediments were associated with distinct microbial community compositions and significant differences in abundances of various N transformation genes. For both characteristics, we observed a more pronounced spatial than seasonal variability within each lake. The eutrophic Lake Baldegg showed a higher denitrification potential with higher nosZ gene (N2O reductase) abundances and higher nirS:nirK (nitrite reductase) ratios, indicating a greater capacity for complete denitrification. Correspondingly, this lake had a higher N removal efficiency. The oligotrophic Lake Sarnen, in contrast, had a higher potential for nitrification. Specifically, it harbored a high abundance of Nitrospira, including some with the potential for comammox. Our results demonstrate that knowledge of the genomic N transformation potential is important for interpreting N process rates and understanding how the lacustrine sedimentary N cycle responds to variations in trophic conditions. IMPORTANCE Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs can lead to eutrophication in surface waters, especially in N-limited coastal ecosystems. Lakes effectively remove reactive N by transforming it to N-2 through microbial denitrification or anammox. The rates and distributions of these microbial processes are affected by factors such as the amount and quality of settling organic material and nitrate concentrations. However, the microbial communities mediating these N transformation processes in freshwater lake sediments remain largely unknown. We provide the first seasonally and spatially resolved metagenomic analysis of the N cycle in sediments of two lakes with different trophic states. We show that lakes with different trophic states select for distinct communities of N-cycling microorganisms with contrasting functional potentials for N transformation. Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs can lead to eutrophication in surface waters, especially in N-limited coastal ecosystems. Lakes effectively remove reactive N by transforming it to N-2 through microbial denitrification or anammox.', 'Eutrophication as a driver of microbial community structure in lake sediments Lake sediments are globally important carbon sinks. Although the fate of organic carbon in lake sediments depends significantly on microorganisms, only few studies have investigated controls on lake sedimentary microbial communities. Here we investigate the impact of anthropogenic eutrophication, which affects redox chemistry and organic matter (OM) sources in sediments, on microbial communities across five lakes in central Switzerland. Lipid biomarkers and distributions of microbial respiration reactions indicate strong increases in aquatic OM contributions and microbial activity with increasing trophic state. Across all lakes, 16S rRNA genes analyses indicate similar depth-dependent zonations at the phylum- and class-level that follow vertical distributions of OM sources and respiration reactions. Yet, there are notable differences, such as higher abundances of nitrifying Bacteria and Archaea in an oligotrophic lake. Furthermore, analyses at the order-level and below suggest that changes in OM sources due to eutrophication cause permanent changes in bacterial community structure. By contrast, archaeal communities are differentiated according to trophic state in recently deposited layers, but converge in older sediments deposited under different trophic regimes. Our study indicates an important role for trophic state in driving lacustrine sediment microbial communities and reveals fundamental differences in the temporal responses of sediment Bacteria and Archaea to eutrophication.']","['bacterioplankton', 'ecosystems', 'sediments', 'microbial', 'plankton', 'sediment', 'planktonic', 'freshwater', 'phytoplankton', 'aquatic']",plankton,Plankton,microbiome,plankton,Aquatic Microbial Ecology,Aquatic Microbial Ecology,19

Transgenic males exhibited impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, detected both in vivo and in the perfused pancreas. Pancreatic insulin content was markedly decreased in diabetic animals, whereas the glucagon content was increased. Postnatal islet development was altered, with an increased alpha -cell to beta -cell ratio. beta -Cell ultrastructure showed signs of severe beta -cell damage, including mitochondrial swelling. This animal model of maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3 should be useful for the further elucidation of the mechanism by which HNF-1 alpha deficiency causes beta -cell dysfunction in this disease.', 'Diabetes relief in mice by glucose-sensing insulin-secreting human alpha-cells Cell-identity switches, in which terminally differentiated cells are converted into different cell types when stressed, represent a widespread regenerative strategy in animals, yet they are poorly documented in mammals. In mice, some glucagon-producing pancreatic alpha-cells and somatostatin-producing delta-cells become insulin-expressing cells after the ablation of insulin-secreting beta-cells, thus promoting diabetes recovery. Whether human islets also display this plasticity, especially in diabetic conditions, remains unknown. Here we show that islet non-beta-cells, namely alpha-cells and pancreatic polypeptide (PPY)-producing gamma-cells, obtained from deceased non-diabetic or diabetic human donors, can be lineage-traced and reprogrammed by the transcription factors PDX1 and MAFA to produce and secrete insulin in response to glucose. When transplanted into diabetic mice, converted human alpha-cells reverse diabetes and continue to produce insulin even after six months. Notably, insulin-producing alpha-cells maintain expression of alpha-cell markers, as seen by deep transcriptomic and proteomic characterization.

On the basis of responses to intraperitoneal glucose, similar to7-mo-old betaIRKO mice were either diabetic (25%) or normally glucose tolerant (75%). Total insulin content was profoundly reduced in pancreata of mutant mice compared with controls. Both groups also exhibited reduced beta-cell mass and islet number. However, insulin mRNA and protein were similar in islets of diabetic and normoglycemic betaIRKO mice compared with controls. Insulin secretion in response to insulin secretagogues from the isolated perfused pancreas was markedly reduced in the diabetic betaIRKOs and to a lesser degree in the nondiabetic betaIRKO group. Pancreatic islets of nondiabetic betaIRKO animals also exhibited defects in glyceraldehyde- and KCl-stimulated insulin release that were milder than in the diabetic animals. Gene expression analysis of islets revealed a modest reduction of GLUT2 and glucokinase gene expression in both the nondiabetic and diabetic mutants. Taken together, these data indicate that loss of functional receptors for insulin in beta-cells leads primarily to profound defects in postnatal beta-cell growth.

In particular, we solve the problem of exact likelihood computation in Boolean networks with probabilistic exponential time delays. Simulations demonstrate the high accuracy of our approach. We apply our method to data of Ivanova et al. (2006), where RNA interference knockdown experiments were used to build a network of the key regulatory genes governing mouse stem cell maintenance and differentiation. In contrast to previous analyses of that data set, our method can identify feedback loops and provides new insights into the interplay of some master regulators in embryonic stem cell development. Motivation: For biological pathways, it is common to measure a gene expression time series after various knockdowns of genes that are putatively involved in the process of interest. These interventional time-resolved data are most suitable for the elucidation of dynamic causal relationships in signaling networks. Even with this kind of data it is still a major and largely unsolved challenge to infer the topology and interaction logic of the underlying regulatory network.', 'Dynamic simulation of regulatory networks using SQUAD Results: We developed SQUAD, a software for the dynamic simulation of signaling networks using the standardized qualitative dynamical systems approach. SQUAD converts the network into a discrete dynamical system, and it uses a binary decision diagram algorithm to identify all the steady states of the system. Then, the software creates a continuous dynamical system and localizes its steady states which are located near the steady states of the discrete system. The software permits to make simulations on the continuous system, allowing for the modification of several parameters. Importantly, SQUAD includes a framework for perturbing networks in a manner similar to what is performed in experimental laboratory protocols, for example by activating receptors or knocking out molecular components. Using this software we have been able to successfully reproduce the behavior of the regulatory network implicated in T-helper cell differentiation. Background: The ambition of most molecular biologists is the understanding of the intricate network of molecular interactions that control biological systems. As scientists uncover the components and the connectivity of these networks, it becomes possible to study their dynamical behavior as a whole and discover what is the specific role of each of their components. Since the behavior of a network is by no means intuitive, it becomes necessary to use computational models to understand its behavior and to be able to make predictions about it. Unfortunately, most current computational models describe small networks due to the scarcity of kinetic data available. To overcome this problem, we previously published a methodology to convert a signaling network into a dynamical system, even in the total absence of kinetic information. In this paper we present a software implementation of such methodology. Conclusion: The simulation of regulatory networks aims at predicting the behavior of a whole system when subject to stimuli, such as drugs, or determine the role of specific components within the network. The predictions can then be used to interpret and/or drive laboratory experiments. SQUAD provides a user-friendly graphical interface, accessible to both computational and experimental biologists for the fast qualitative simulation of large regulatory networks for which kinetic data is not necessarily available.', 'A method for the generation of standardized qualitative dynamical systems of regulatory networks Background: Modeling of molecular networks is necessary to understand their dynamical properties. While a wealth of information on molecular connectivity is available, there are still relatively few data regarding the precise stoichiometry and kinetics of the biochemical reactions underlying most molecular networks. This imbalance has limited the development of dynamical models of biological networks to a small number of well-characterized systems. To overcome this problem, we wanted to develop a methodology that would systematically create dynamical models of regulatory networks where the flow of information is known but the biochemical reactions are not. There are already diverse methodologies for modeling regulatory networks, but we aimed to create a method that could be completely standardized, i.e. independent of the network under study, so as to use it systematically. Results: We developed a set of equations that can be used to translate the graph of any regulatory network into a continuous dynamical system. Furthermore, it is also possible to locate its stable steady states. The method is based on the construction of two dynamical systems for a given network, one discrete and one continuous. The stable steady states of the discrete system can be found analytically, so they are used to locate the stable steady states of the continuous system numerically. To provide an example of the applicability of the method, we used it to model the regulatory network controlling T helper cell differentiation. Conclusion: The proposed equations have a form that permit any regulatory network to be translated into a continuous dynamical system, and also find its steady stable states. We showed that by applying the method to the T helper regulatory network it is possible to find its known states of activation, which correspond the molecular profiles observed in the precursor and effector cell types.']","['signaling', 'computational', 'networks', 'genes', 'regulatory', 'stochastic', 'dynamical', 'gene', 'transcriptional', 'models']",biology,GeneRegulation,GeneRegulation,gene,Gene Regulatory Networks,Gene Regulatory Networks,19

This association prevails up to the middle Smithian and is followed by a prominent spore spike similar to the global spore spike reported from the Permian-Triassic boundary. Like that of the end-Permian, the middle Smithian spore spike is associated with a negative isotope excursion and is succeeded by a major marine faunal extinction event in the late Smithian. The recurrent patterns observed at the Permian-Triassic boundary and in the middle-upper Smithian suggest a common cause such as massive ejections of volcanic gases.

This calibration indicates that the most significant and fastest Early Triassic carbon isotope perturbations occur between the earliest Smithian and the early Spathian, thus spanning a time interval of about 1 My.

The new U-Pb age considerably reduces the absolute age gap comprised between the Permian-Triassic boundary and the Spathian (late Early Triassic).', 'Evolution of Early Triassic outer platform paleoenvironments in the Nanpanjiang Basin (South China) and their significance for the biotic recovery Detailed microfacies and paleoenvironmental analyses were conducted through the Early Triassic interval of the outer platform ammonoid-rich series of the Nanpanjiang Basin (Luolou Formation, Guangxi Province, South China). Extensive investigations on outcrops and on thin sections reveal that the widely reported well-diversified latest Permian fauna, dominated by abundant corals, calcareous algae, calcareous sponges, crinoids, brachiopods, gastropods, ostracods and foraminifera, is abruptly replaced by decimated Early Triassic communities essentially composed of low-diversity bivalves, microgastropods, ostracods, and rare foraminifera. Along with this drastic change in faunal assemblages, the recolonization of devastated habitats by calcimicrobial frameworks is observed in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. Calcimicrobialites of Griesbachian age are followed by mixed, ammonoid- and conodont-rich carbonate-siliciclastic series consisting of dark, suboxic, laminated mudstones intercalated with organic-rich shales of Dienerian to late Smithian age. The carbonate-siliciclastic series are interrupted by a brief carbonate episode during the early-middle Smithian. Massive carbonate production resumes only from the early Spathian onward and persists throughout the Spathian. The initial deposition of both carbonate episodes is coeval with (i) re-establishment of well-oxygenated conditions, (ii) a marked (early Smithian) to extreme (early Spathian) ammonoid/conodont diversification, (iii) a significant increase in the skeletal grain diversity and abundance and, (iv) peak carbon isotope values. A short interval of black, organic-rich shales precedes the onset of these two distinct carbonate events, which are both marked by a positive carbonate carbon isotope excursion known from other Tethyan marine localities. The comparison between the Early Triassic stratigraphic evolution of Tethyan outer platform paleoenvironments and platform/basin margin settings of the Nanpanjiang Basin suggests a causal connection between large fluctuations of the global carbon cycle, climate shifts, sea-level changes, oxygen availability in the oceans and the biological rediversification in the wake of the end-Permian biotic crisis.

The response to tissue damage varies across tissues and between species. Determining the natural mechanisms behind regeneration in model organisms that regenerate well can help us develop strategies for tissue recovery in species with poor regenerative capacity (such as humans). The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is one of the most accessible vertebrate models to study regeneration. In this Primer, we highlight the tools available to study regeneration in the zebrafish, provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying regeneration in this system and discuss future perspectives for the field.', 'Induction of Myocardial Infarction in Adult Zebrafish Using Cryoinjury The mammalian heart is incapable of significant regeneration following an acute injury such as myocardial infarction(1). By contrast, urodele amphibians and teleost fish retain a remarkable capacity for cardiac regeneration with little or no scarring throughout life(2,3). It is not known why only some non-mammalian vertebrates can recreate a complete organ from remnant tissues(4,5). To understand the molecular and cellular differences between regenerative responses in different species, we need to use similar approaches for inducing acute injuries. Here, we present a method to induce a reproducible disc-shaped infarct of the zebrafish ventricle by cryoinjury. This injury model is based on rapid freezing-thawing tissue, which results in massive cell death of about 20% of cardiomyocytes of the ventricular wall. First, a small incision was made through the chest with iridectomy scissors to access the heart. The ventricular wall was directly frozen by applying for 23-25 seconds a stainless steel cryoprobe precooled in liquid nitrogen. To stop the freezing of the heart, fish water at room temperature was dropped on the tip of the cryoprobe. The procedure is well tolerated by animals, with a survival rate of 95%. To characterize the regenerative process, the hearts were collected and fixed at different days after cryoinjury. Subsequently, the specimen were embedded for cryosectioning. The slides with sections were processed for histological analysis, in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. This undertaking enhances our understanding of the factors that are required for the regenerative plasticity in the zebrafish, and provide new insights into the machinery of cardiac regeneration. A conceptual and molecular understanding of heart regeneration in zebrafish will impact both developmental biology and regenerative medicine. In mammals, the most frequently used model to study cardiac repair has been acute ischemia after a ligation of the coronary artery or tissue destruction after cryoinjury(6,7). The cardiac regeneration in newts and zebrafish has been predominantly studied after a partial resection of the ventricular apex(2,3). Recently, several groups have established the cryoinjury technique in adult zebrafish(8-10). This method has a great potential because it allows a comparative discussion of the results obtained from the mammalian and non-mammalian species.', 'Retinal function and morphology in two zebrafish models of oculo-renal syndromes We characterized visual system defects in two recessive zebrafish mutants oval and elipsa. These mutants share the syndromic phenotype of outer retinal dystrophy in conjunction with cystic renal disorder. We tested the function of the larval visual system in a behavioural assay, eliciting optokinetic eye movements by high-contrast motion stimulation while recording eye movements in parallel. Visual stimulation did not elicit eye movements in mutant larvae, while spontaneous eye movements could be observed. The retina proved to be unresponsive to light using electroretinography, indicative of a defect in the outer retina. Histological analysis of mutant retinas revealed progressive degeneration of photoreceptors, initiated in central retinal locations and spreading to more peripheral regions with increasing age. The inner retina remains unaffected by the mutation. Photoreceptors display cell type-specific immunoreactivity prior to apoptotic cell death, arguing for a dystrophic defect. Genomic mapping employing simple sequence-length polymorphisms located both mutations on different regions of zebrafish linkage group 9. These mutants may serve as accessible animal models of human outer retinal dystrophies, including oculo-renal diseases, and show the general usefulness of a behavioural genetic approach to study visual system development in the model vertebrate zebrafish.']","['zebrafish', 'vertebrate', 'regenerative', 'regeneration', 'fish', 'cardiac', 'heart', 'myocardial', 'retinal', 'retina']",biology,Regeneration,Regeneration,zebrafish,Zebrafish Regeneration,Zebrafish Regeneration,19

However, most of these metabolites remain uncharacterized, since trans-AT PKSs frequently occur in poorly studied microbes and feature a remarkable array of non-canonical biosynthetic components with poorly understood functions. As a consequence, genome-guided natural product identification has been challenging. To enable de novo structural predictions for trans-AT PKS-derived polyketides, we developed the trans-AT PKS polyketide predictor (TransATor). TransATor is a versatile bio- and chemoinformatics web application that suggests informative chemical structures for even highly aberrant trans-AT PKS biosynthetic gene clusters, thus permitting hypothesis-based, targeted biotechnological discovery and biosynthetic studies. We demonstrate the applicative scope in several examples, including the characterization of new variants of bioactive natural products as well as structurally new polyketides from unusual bacterial sources.', 'Novel formaldehyde-activating enzyme in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 required for growth on methanol Formaldehyde is toxic for all organisms from bacteria to humans due to its reactivity with biological macromolecules. Organisms that grow aerobically on single-carbon compounds such as methanol and methane face a special challenge in this regard because formaldehyde is a central metabolic intermediate during methylotrophic growth. In the alpha -proteobacterium Methylobacterium extorquens AML, we found a previously unknown enzyme that efficiently catalyzes the removal of formaldehyde: it catalyzes the condensation of formaldehyde and tetrahydromethanopterin to methylene tetrahydromethanopterin, a reaction which also proceeds spontaneously, but at a lower rate than that of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Formaldehyde-activating enzyme (Fae) was purified from M. extorquens AM1 and found to be one of the major proteins in the cytoplasm. The encoding gene is located within a cluster of genes for enzymes involved in the further oxidation of methylene tetrahydromethanopterin to CO2. Mutants of M. extorquens AM1 defective in Fae were able to grow on succinate but not on methanol and were much more sensitive toward methanol and formaldehyde. Uncharacterized orthologs to this enzyme are predicted to be encoded by uncharacterized genes from archaea, indicating that this type of enzyme occurs outside the methylotrophic bacteria.', 'Comparison of the proteome of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 grown under methylotrophic and nonmethylotrophic conditions Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 is a facultative methylotrophic bacterium that is capable of growing in the presence of methanol as the sole carbon and energy source, but is also able to grow on a limited number of C-2, C-3, and C-4 compounds, for example succinate. This study provides a proteomic view of the cellular adaptation of M. extorquens AM 1 to growth on methanol and succinate, respectively. Cytosolic proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis employing overlapping pH ranges and visualized by silver nitrate or fluorescence staining. A proteomic reference map containing 229 different proteins identified by peptide mass fingerprinting of tryptic fragments was established. Comparative proteome profiling of methanol- and succinate-grown cells led to the identification of 68 proteins that are induced under methylotrophic growth conditions in comparison to growth on succinate. This group includes most proteins known to be directly involved in methanol oxidation to CO2 and in assimilation of one carbon units by the serine cycle as well as 18 proteins without any assigned function and two proteins with a predicted regulatory function. Furthermore, the proteome analysis revealed putative isoenzymes for formaldehyde-activating enzyme Fae, malyl-CoA lyase, malate-dehydrogenase, and fumarase, that need to be characterized functionally in future studies.']","['methylobacterium', 'bacterial', 'bacteria', 'biosynthesis', 'biosynthetic', 'enzymes', 'methylotrophic', 'enzyme', 'coli', 'dehydrogenase']",methylobacterium,Methylotrophy,Microbiology,methylobacterium,Methylotrophic Bacteria,Methylotrophic Bacteria Biosynthesis,19

To assess whether wound-healing disorders are associated with a defect in fibroblast growth factor regulation, we have now investigated the expression of these mitogens as well as their receptors in normal and wounded skin of genetically diabetic db/db mice, which are characterized by their impaired wound healing. We demonstrate that induction of keratinocyte growth factor expression in these mice is significantly reduced and delayed compared to normal mice. Induction of acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGP) and basic FGF expression was earlier in diabetic mice than in normal mice, but by 3 d after injury expression of these mitogens had already returned to the basal levels. In contrast, elevated levels of acidic FGF and basic FGF transcripts were detected within the first 5 d in wounds from normal mice. Thus, FGFs seem to be expressed in a limited fashion in the wound tissue of db/db mice during the period when re-epithelialization and granulation tissue formation normally occur. These findings provide an explanation for the beneficial effect of exogenous FGF in the treatment of impaired wound healing in these animals and suggest that induction ofKGF early in repair may be critical for the rapid re-epithelialization in normal wound healing.', 'Nrf2 transcription factor, a novel target of keratinocyte growth factor action which regulates gene expression and inflammation in the healing skin wound Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a potent mitogen for epithelial cells, and it promotes survival of these cells under stress conditions. In a search for KGF-regulated genes in keratinocytes, we identified the gene encoding the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2 is a key player in the cellular stress response. This might be of particular importance during wound healing, where large amounts of reactive oxygen species are produced as a defense against invading bacteria. Therefore, we studied the wound repair process in Nrf2 knockout mice. Interestingly, the expression of various key players involved in wound healing was significantly reduced in early wounds of the Nrf2 knockout animals, and the late phase of repair was characterized by prolonged inflammation. However, these differences in gene expression were not reflected by obvious histological abnormalities. The normal healing rate appears to be at least partially due to an up-regulation of the related transcription factor Nrf3, which was also identified as a target of KGF and which was coexpressed with Nrf2 in the healing skin wound. Taken together, our results reveal novel roles of the KGF-regulated transcription factors Nrf2 and possibly Nrf3 in the control of gene expression and inflammation during cutaneous wound repair.', 'Expression and function of keratinocyte growth factor and activin in skin morphogenesis and cutaneous wound repair Reepithelialization and granulation tissue formation during cutaneous wound repair are mediated by a wide variety of growth and differentiation factors. Recent studies from our laboratory provided evidence for an important role of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in the repair of the injured epithelium and for a novel function of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily member activin in granulation tissue formation, KGF is weakly expressed in human skin, but is strongly upregulated in dermal fibroblasts after skin injury. Its binding to a transmembrane receptor on keratinocytes induces proliferation and migration of these cells. Furthermore, KGF has been shown to protect epithelial cells from the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species. We have identified a series of KGF-regulated genes that are Likely to play a role in these processes, In addition to KGF, activin seems to be a novel player in wound healing. Activin expression is hardly detectable in nonwounded skin, but this factor is highly expressed in redifferentiating keratinocytes of the hyperproliferative wound epithelium as well as in cells of the granulation tissue. To gain insight into the role of activin in wound repair, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress activin in basal keratinocytes of the epidermis, These mice were characterized by a hyperthickened epidermis and by dermal fibrosis, Most importantly, overexpression of activin strongly enhanced the process of granulation tissue formation, demonstrating a novel and important role of activin in cutaneous wound repair.']","['keratinocyte', 'keratinocytes', 'wound', 'wounds', 'injury', 'fibroblasts', 'cytokines', 'tissue', 'fibroblast', 'skin']",keratinocyte,Healing,Wound-healing,keratinocyte,Skin Healing,Skin Healing Processes,19

Synaptic transmission between any given pair of neurons is typically a dynamic process with presynaptic action potentials (APs) evoking depressing or facilitating postsynaptic potentials when presynaptic APs occur within hundreds of milliseconds of each other. In order to understand neocortical function, it is therefore important to investigate such short-term synaptic plasticity at synapses between different types of neocortical neurons. Here, we examine short-term synaptic dynamics between excitatory neurons in different layers of the mouse C2 barrel column through in vitro whole-cell recordings. We find layer-dependent short-term plasticity, with depression being dominant at many synaptic connections. Interestingly, however, presynaptic layer 2 neurons predominantly give rise to facilitating excitatory synaptic output at short interspike intervals of 10 and 30 ms. Previous studies have found prominent burst firing of excitatory neurons in supragranular layers of awake mice. The facilitation we observed in the synaptic output of layer 2 may, therefore, be functionally relevant, possibly serving to enhance the postsynaptic impact of burst firing.', 'In Vivo Optogenetic Stimulation of Neocortical Excitatory Neurons Drives Brain-State-Dependent Inhibition Background: Synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neocortical neurons are important for mammalian sensory perception. Synaptic transmission between identified neurons within neocortical microcircuits has mainly been studied in brain slice preparations in vitro. Here, we investigate brain-state-dependent neocortical synaptic interactions in vivo by combining the specificity of optogenetic stimulation with the precision of whole-cell recordings from postsynaptic excitatory glutamatergic neurons and GFP-labeled inhibitory GABAergic neurons targeted through two-photon microscopy. Results: Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) stimulation of excitatory layer 213 barrel cortex neurons evoked larger and faster depolarizing postsynaptic potentials and more synaptically driven action potentials in fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic neurons compared to both non-fast-spiking (NFS) GABAergic neurons and postsynaptic excitatory pyramidal neurons located within the same neocortical microcircuit. The number of action potentials evoked in ChR2-expressing neurons showed low trial-to-trial variability, but postsynaptic responses varied strongly with near-linear dependence upon spontaneously driven changes in prestimulus membrane potential. Postsynaptic responses in excitatory neurons had reversal potentials, which were hyperpolarized relative to action potential threshold and were therefore inhibitory. Reversal potentials measured in postsynaptic GABAergic neurons were close to action potential threshold. Postsynaptic inhibitory neurons preferentially fired synaptically driven action potentials from spontaneously depolarized network states, with stronger state-dependent modulation in NFS GABAergic neurons compared to FS GABAergic neurons. Conclusions: Inhibitory neurons appear to dominate neocortical microcircuit function, receiving stronger local excitatory synaptic input and firing more action potentials compared to excitatory neurons. In mouse layer 2/3 barrel cortex, we propose that strong state-dependent recruitment of inhibitory neurons drives competition among excitatory neurons enforcing sparse coding.', 'Microcircuits of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse barrel cortex Avermann M, Tomm C, Mateo C, Gerstner W, Petersen CC.

Here, we have combined optogenetic stimulation, whole cell recordings, and computational modeling to define key functional microcircuits within layer 2/3 of mouse primary somatosensory barrel cortex. In vitro optogenetic stimulation of excitatory layer 2/3 neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 evoked a rapid sequence of excitation followed by inhibition. Fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic neurons received large-amplitude, fast-rising depolarizing postsynaptic potentials, often driving action potentials. In contrast, the same optogenetic stimulus evoked small-amplitude, subthreshold postsynaptic potentials in excitatory and non-fast-spiking (NFS) GABAergic neurons. To understand the synaptic mechanisms underlying this network activity, we investigated unitary synaptic connectivity through multiple simultaneous whole cell recordings. FS GABAergic neurons received unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials with higher probability, larger amplitudes, and faster kinetics compared with NFS GABAergic neurons and other excitatory neurons. Both FS and NFS GABAergic neurons evoked robust inhibition on postsynaptic layer 2/3 neurons. A simple computational model based on the experimentally determined electrophysiological properties of the different classes of layer 2/3 neurons and their unitary synaptic connectivity accounted for key aspects of the network activity evoked by optogenetic stimulation, including the strong recruitment of FS GABAergic neurons acting to suppress firing of excitatory neurons. We conclude that FS GABAergic neurons play an important role in neocortical microcircuit function through their strong local synaptic connectivity, which might contribute to driving sparse coding in excitatory layer 2/3 neurons of mouse barrel cortex in vivo.']","['neurons', 'neuronal', 'neurones', 'neuron', 'neural', 'synaptic', 'cortex', 'synapses', 'somatosensory', 'brain']",brain,Neuroscience,Neurobiology,brain,Neural Networks,Neural Activity,19

Methods: Using muscle-specific gain-and loss-of-function models for PGC-1 alpha in combination with the myotoxic agent cardiotoxin (CTX), we explored the role of this transcriptional coactivator in muscle damage and inflammation. Results: Interestingly, we observed PGC-1 alpha-dependent effects at the early stages of regeneration, in particular regarding macrophage accumulation and polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 to the anti-inflammatory M2 type, a faster resolution of necrosis and protection against the development of fibrosis after multiple CTX-induced injuries. Conclusions: PGC-1 alpha exerts beneficial effects on muscle inflammation that might contribute to the therapeutic effects of elevated muscle PGC-1 alpha in different models of muscle wasting.', 'The transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 alpha is dispensable for chronic overload-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy and metabolic remodeling Skeletal muscle mass loss and dysfunction have been linked to many diseases. Conversely, resistance exercise, mainly by activating mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), promotes skeletal muscle hypertrophy and exerts several therapeutic effects. Moreover, mTORC1, along with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), regulates skeletal muscle metabolism. However, it is unclear whether PGC-1 alpha is required for skeletal muscle adaptations after overload. Here we show that although chronic overload of skeletal muscle via synergist ablation (SA) strongly induces hypertrophy and a switch toward a slow-contractile phenotype, these effects were independent of PGC-1 alpha. In fact, SA down-regulated PGC-1 alpha expression and led to a repression of energy metabolism. Interestingly, however, PGC-1 alpha deletion preserved peak force after SA. Taken together, our data suggest that PGC-1 alpha is not involved in skeletal muscle remodeling induced by SA.', 'Skeletal muscle fiber-type switching, exercise intolerance, and myopathy in PGC-1 alpha muscle-specific knock-out animals The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) is a key integrator of neuromuscular activity in skeletal muscle. Ectopic expression of PGC-1 alpha in muscle results in increased mitochondrial number and function as well as an increase in oxidative, fatigue-resistant muscle fibers. Whole body PGC-1 alpha knock-out mice have a very complex phenotype but do not have a marked skeletal muscle phenotype. We thus analyzed skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1 alpha knock-out mice to identify a specific role for PGC-1 alpha in skeletal muscle function. These mice exhibit a shift from oxidative type I and IIa toward type IIx and IIb muscle fibers. Moreover, skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1 alpha knock-out animals have reduced endurance capacity and exhibit fiber damage and elevated markers of inflammation following treadmill running.

Rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide have been predicted to stimulate the growth of forest trees. However, long-term effects on trees growing to maturity and to canopy closure while exposed to elevated CO2 have never been examined. We compared tree ring chronologies of Mediterranean Quercus ilex which have been continuously exposed to elevated CO2 (around 650 mu mol mol(-1)) since they were seedlings, near two separate natural CO2 springs with those from trees at nearby ambient-CO2 'control' sites. Trees grown under high CO2 for 30 years (1964-93) showed a 12% greater final radial stem width than those growing at the ambient-CO2 control sites. However, this stimulation was largely due to responses when trees were young. By the time trees were 25-30 y old the annual difference in tree ring width between low and high CO2 grown trees had disappeared. At any given tree age, elevated CO2 had a relatively greater positive effect on tree ring width in years with a dry spring compared to years with more rainfall between April and May. This indicates a beneficial effect of elevated CO2 on tree water relations under drought stress. Our data suggest that the early regeneration phase of forest stands can be accelerated in CO2-enriched atmospheres and that maximum biomass per land area may be reached sooner than under lower CO2 concentrations. In our study, high CO2 grown Q. ilex trees reached the same stem basal area at the age of 26 y as control trees at 29 y,i.e. three years earlier (faster turnover of carbon?). Reliable predictions of the future development of forests need to account for the variable responses of trees over their entire lifetime. Such responses to elevated CO2 can presently only be assessed at such unique field sites."", 'Central European hardwood trees in a high-CO2 future: synthesis of an 8-year forest canopy CO2 enrichment project Rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 is not only changing the climate system but may also affect the biosphere directly through stimulation of plant growth and ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. Although forest ecosystems play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, experimental information on forest responses to rising CO2 is scarce, due to the sheer size of trees. Here, we present a synthesis of the only study world-wide where a diverse set of mature broadleaved trees growing in a natural forest has been exposed to future atmospheric CO2 levels (c. 550ppm) by free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE). We show that litter production, leaf traits and radial growth across the studied hardwood species remained unaffected by elevated CO2 over 8years. CO2 enrichment reduced tree water consumption resulting in detectable soil moisture savings. Soil air CO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon both increased suggesting enhanced below-ground activity. Carbon release to the rhizosphere and/or higher soil moisture primed nitrification and nitrate leaching under elevated CO2; however, the export of dissolved organic carbon remained unaltered.Synthesis. Our findings provide no evidence for carbon-limitation in five central European hardwood trees at current ambient CO2 concentrations. The results of this long-term study challenge the idea of a universal CO2 fertilization effect on forests, as commonly assumed in climate-carbon cycle models.', ""The responses of alpine grassland to four seasons of CO2 enrichment: a synthesis Alpine grassland at 2 470 m altitude in the Swiss Central Alps was exposed to elevated CO2 by using open top chambers (16 ambient, 16 elevated CO2). Some plots received mineral fertilizer at a rate of N-deposition commonly measured in low altitude parts of Europe. Here we present a summary of results and data from the final harvest. Above-ground biomass measured after the completion of growth in the fourth season of treatment was not affected by CO2 enrichment as was found by previous biometric estimates, but mean below-ground biomass was slightly stimulated (+ 12%, n.s.). In con trast, net CO2 uptake per unit land area was strongly stimulated by CO2 enrichment al the beginning of the experiment, and during the early part of each season. However, the CO2 stimulation decreased during the later part of each growing season. By year four, also mid-season differences in CO2 uptake per unit land area had disappeared. Neither microbial biomass, soil respiration in the laboratory, nor in situ land-area-based CO2 evolution during the 10 week growing season increased under elevated CO2. The total biomass N-pool and free soil nitrate and ammonium (capture by ion exchange resin bags) remained unaffected, whereas leaf nitrogen concentration was reduced and nonstructural carbohydrate concentration increased under elevated CO2 in forbs. These differences in tissue composition largely disappeared during senescence and litter formation. Despite low CO2 responsiveness at ecosystem level, species responses differed in terms of nitrogen, carbohydrates, tillering and flowering, suggesting the possibility for long-term changes in community structure. Addition of NPK equivalent to 40 kg N ha(-1) a(-1) had massive effects on all plant traits studied, but did not enable stimulated growth under CO2 enrichment. However, when fertilizer and CO2 enrichment were provided jointly, soil microbes were stimulated indicating a co-limitation by carbon and nutrients (most likely nitrogen). Since responses to elevated CO2 were absent in both warm and cold growing seasons, we conclude that this late successional plant community is carbon saturated at current atmospheric CO2 concentrations for reasons not directly related to nutrient supply and climate. Perhaps, contrary to our expectation, evolutionary adjustments of this ''old'' ecosystem to the life conditions at high altitudes caused carbon to become a surplus resource today.""]","['forests', 'carbon', 'forest', 'co2', 'biomass', 'climate', 'photosynthesis', 'ecosystem', 'emissions', 'ecosystems']",ecosystem,Forestry,carbon_cycle,carbon dioxide,Forest Carbon Cycles,Forest Carbon Dynamics,19

Here, we present a chironomid-based quantitative reconstruction of mean July air temperatures (T-July) throughout the Holocene for a remote high-mountain lake, Schwarzsee ob Solden, situated above the treeline at 2796 m a.s.l. in the Austrian Alps. Applying a chironomid-temperature inference model developed from lakes of the Alpine region to a high-resolution chironomid record from the lake provides evidence for early Holocene (ca 10000-8600 cal yr BP) T-July of up to 8.5 degrees C i.e. >4 degrees C above the modern (1977-2006) mean July temperature. The reconstruction reveals the so-called '8.2-ka cold event' centered at ca 8250-8000 cal yr BP with temperatures ca 3 degrees C below the early-Holocene thermal maximum. Rather warm (ca 6 degrees C) and productive conditions prevailed during ca 7900-4500 cal yr BP. The chironomid record suggests a climate transition between ca 5200 and 4500 cal yr BP to cooler T-July. A distinct cooling trend is evident from ca 4500 until ca 2500 cal yr BP. Thereafter, the study site experienced its coldest conditions (around 4 degrees C or less) throughout the rest of the Holocene, with the exception of the warming trend during the late 20th century. Beside other factors, the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation seems to be the major driving force for the long-term trends in T-July at high altitudes in the Eastern Alps. Due to the extreme location of the lake and the limited temperature range represented by the applied calibration data set, the chironomid-based temperature reconstruction fails to track phases of the late-Holocene climatic history with T-July cooler than 4 degrees C. Further chironomid-based palaeoclimate model and down-core studies are required to address this problem, provide more realistic T-July estimates from undisturbed high-altitude lakes in the Alps, and extract a reliable regional temperature signal.

After smoothing to reduce the high between-sample variability of inferred temperatures, the reconstruction indicates July air temperatures of 10.4-10.9degreesC at the end of the Younger Dryas, of 11.9-12.8degreesC during the early and mid-Holocene (11500-4000 cal. BP), and slightly lower temperatures of 11.5-12.0degreesC during the late Holocene (3500-1000 cal. BP). A warming trend inferred for the past millennium is most likely an artifact of human impact on Hinterburgsee's chironomid fauna, rather than a genuine temperature signal. The most prominent climatological events during the Holocene were two periods of lower temperatures at c. 10700-10500 cal. BP and 8200-7700 cal. BP and an abrupt shift to a cooler late-Holocene climate around 4000-3700 cal. BP. Although the chironomid-inferred climate signals were within the prediction error of the model (1.51degreesC), major inferred temperature changes agree well with other northern and central European climate reconstructions and underline the potential of subfossil chironomid analysis to reconstruct even the moderate climatic changes within the Holocene."", 'Summer temperature development 18,000-14,000 cal. BP recorded by a new chironomid record from Burgaschisee, Swiss Plateau The termination of the Last Ice Age after the Last Glacial maximum (LGM) represents a dynamic period in the history of the circum-north Atlantic region. So far, there are few reliably dated climatic reconstructions covering the Lateglacial period prior to 14,700 cal. BP in Central and Northern Europe. We present a new chironomid record for the period 18,000-14,000 cal. BP, from Burgaschisee, Switzerland. Chironomid assemblages immediately following glacier retreat were dominated by taxa indicative of cold, oligotrophic conditions such as Sergentia coracina-type and Micropsectra radialis-type. A gradual transition to assemblages with moderate abundances of taxa indicative of warmer climatic conditions such as Dicrotendipes nevosus-type and Tanytarsus glabrescens-type started after ca. 16,100 cal. BP. This initial and gradual chironomid assemblage shift culminated in a more pronounced and rapid inferred temperature change at the Oldest Dryas/Bolling transition at ca. 14,700 cal. BP, where further types indicative of warm conditions such as Tanytarsus lactescens-type first occurred and replaced chironomids indicative of colder conditions such as Paracladius and Protanypus. We estimated past July air temperature changes from the chironomid assemblages by applying to the record a chironomid-temperature transfer function that is based on chironomid distribution data from 274 lakes in Switzerland and Norway. The resulting reconstruction, which features a sample-specific root mean square error of prediction of 1.36-1.46 degrees C, indicates temperatures around 9 degrees C at the beginning of the record. An initial gradual warming phase initiating at ca. 16,100 cal. BP is recorded reaching values around 10 degrees C for the period 16,100-15,500 cal. BP. Temperatures continue to increase reaching values around 12 degrees C for the period preceding the Bolling warming, when temperatures rose rapidly to values around 15 degrees C. The early temperature rise to values of 10-12 degrees C prior to the Bolling warming agrees with widespread vegetation changes recently reported for this region based on palaeobotanical analyses, which indicate a shift from herbaceous tundra to shrub tundra with low density tree birch stands with open canopies. Together, these results suggest an earlier Lateglacial temperature increase in southwest Central Europe than expected based on earlier palaeobotanical reconstructions, although with a less pronounced warming than has been reported for ca. 16,000 cal. BP from south of the Alps. This early Lateglacial warming agrees with glacier reconstructions which suggest several step-wise reductions of glacier extent in this period as well as with evidence from other palaeotemperature reconstructions and suggests that not only Southern Europe but significant parts of Europe north of the Alps may have been characterized by early Lateglacial warming well before the rapid warming at ca. 14,700 cal.

In the Caenorhabditis elegans one-cell stage embryo, the spindle becomes asymmetrically positioned during anaphase through the action of as-yet unidentified cortical force generators that pull on astral microtubules and that depend on two G alpha proteins and associated proteins(1,2). We performed spindle-severing experiments following temporally restricted gene inactivation and drug exposure, and established that microtubule dynamics and dynein are both required for generating efficient pulling forces. We found that the G alpha-associated proteins GPR-1/2 and LIN-5 interact in vivo with LIS-1, a component of the dynein complex. Moreover, we discovered that the LIN-5, GPR-1/2 and the G alpha proteins promote the presence of the dynein complex at the cell cortex. Our findings suggest a mechanism by which the G alpha proteins enable GPR-1/2 and LIN-5 recruitment to the cortex, thus ensuring the presence of cortical dynein. Together with microtubule dynamics, this allows pulling forces to be exerted and proper cell division to be achieved.', 'Spindle positioning during the asymmetric first cell division of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos Cell division during development in many cases generates daughter cells that differ not only in fate, but also in size. We investigate the mechanisms that ensure proper spindle positioning during such asymmetric divisions using the one-cell stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo as a model system. We utilized a UV laser microbeam as an in vivo microtubule-severing device to probe the forces driving spindle positioning. Our results indicate that extra-spindle pulling forces acting on the spindle poles dictate spindle position along the anterior-posterior embryonic axis. Importantly, forces acting on the posterior spindle pole appear more extensive than those acting on the anterior one, thus explaining the overall posterior spindle displacement that leads to the asymmetric division of the wild-type one-cell stage embryo. In separate work, we analysed a locus called zyg-8, which plays a key role in ensuring proper spindle positioning. Our data show that zyg-8 is required to promote microtubule growth and/or stability during anaphase. We identified the molecular nature of the zyg-8 locus in the course of a large-scale RNAi-based functional genomics screen. ZYG-8 harbours two notable protein domains: a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase domain, and a domain related to doublecortin, a human microtubule-associated protein involved in neuronal migration.', 'Polarity controls forces governing asymmetric spindle positioning in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo Cell divisions that create daughter cells of different sizes are crucial for the generation of cell diversity during animal development(1). In such asymmetric divisions, the mitotic spindle must be asymmetrically positioned at the end of anaphase(2,3). The mechanisms by which cell polarity translates to asymmetric spindle positioning remain unclear. Here we examine the nature of the forces governing asymmetric spindle positioning in the single-cell-stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. To reveal the forces that act on each spindle pole, we removed the central spindle in living embryos either physically with an ultraviolet laser microbeam, or genetically by RNA-mediated interference of a kinesin(4). We show that pulling forces external to the spindle act on the two spindle poles. A stronger net force acts on the posterior pole, thereby explaining the overall posterior displacement seen in wild-type embryos. We also show that the net force acting on each spindle pole is under control of the par genes that are required for cell polarity along the anterior-posterior embryonic axis. Finally, we discuss simple mathematical models that describe the main features of spindle pole behaviour. Our work suggests a mechanism for generating asymmetry in spindle positioning by varying the net pulling force that acts on each spindle pole, thus allowing for the generation of daughter cells with different sizes.']","['spindle', 'elegans', 'embryos', 'cells', 'embryo', 'mechanisms', 'chromosomes', 'centrosomes', 'cell', 'formation']",embryo,Cytokinesis,cytokinesis,embryo,Spindle Mechanisms,Cell Division Mechanisms,19

The flavonoid content of root exudates of individual seedlings of Glycine max cv. Preston was analyzed by a sensitive method that combines the adsorption of flavonoids on cellulose acetate filter strips and their separation by nano thin-layer chromatography plates, with their identification and quantification by an absorption scanner. B. japonicum 110spc4 which is able to form nitrogen-fixing nodules with this legume, caused a significant increase in daidzein, coumestrol, and genistein levels in root exudates of infected seedlings. The flavonoid accumulation can be attributed to the presence of suitable rhizobial lipooligosaccharide signals, called Nod factors. This conclusion is based on the following results: 1) B. japonicum Delta 1240, a Nod(-) mutant, lacking nodD(1)D(2)YABCS and therefore unable to produce Nod factors, failed to induce flavonoid accumulation. 2) Enhanced levels of daidzein, coumestrol, and genistein were also observed after G. max seedlings were treated with pure Nod factor of B. japonicum in nanomolar concentrations. 3) A similar flavonoid accumulation was induced by a nonsulfated Nod factor of Rhizobium sp. NGR234, another soybean-nodulating bacterium. Comparative assays with three Nod factors of NGR234, differing in the substitution of the 2-O-methylfucose residue, suggest that in the symbiosis with G. max the absence of the sulfate group is essential for the specific induction of flavonoid accumulation. Our data further develop the interaction model involving flavonoids and Nod factors as components of the signal chain between microsymbionts and legume host plants.', 'NOD FACTORS OF RHIZOBIUM ARE A KEY TO THE LEGUME DOOR Symbiotic interactions between rhizobia and legumes are largely controlled by reciprocal signal exchange. Legume roots excrete flavonoids which induce rhizobial nodulation genes to synthesize and excrete lipo-oligosaccharide Nod factors. In turn, Nod factors provoke deformation of the root hairs and nodule primordium formation. Normally, rhizobia enter roots through infection threads in markedly curled root hairs. If Nod factors are responsible for symbiosis-specific root hair deformation, they could also be the signal for entry of rhizobia into legume roots. We tested this hypothesis by adding, at inoculation, NodNGR-factors to signal-production-deficient mutants of the broad-host-range Rhizobium sp. NGR234 and Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA110. Between 10(-7) M and 10(-6) M NodNGR factors permitted these NodABC(-) mutants to penetrate, nodulate and fix nitrogen on Vigna unguiculata and Glycine max, respectively. NodNGR factors also allowed Rhizobium fredii strain USDA257 to enter and fix nitrogen on Calopogonium caeruleum, a nonhost. Detailed cytological investigations of V. unguiculata showed that the NodABC(-) mutant NGR Delta nodABC, in the presence of NodNGR factors, entered roots in the same way as the wild-type bacterium. Since infection threads were also present in the resulting nodules, we conclude that Nod factors are the signals that permit rhizobia to penetrate legume roots via infection threads.', 'PERCEPTION OF RHIZOBIUM NODULATION FACTORS BY TOMATO CELLS AND INACTIVATION BY ROOT CHITINASES The bacterial genera Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium, nitrogen-fixing symbionts of legumes, secrete specific lipo chitooligosaccharides that induce the formation of nodules on their host plants. When preparations of such nodulation-inducing factors (Nod factors) were added to suspension-cultured tomato cells, a rapid and transient alkalinization of the culture medium occurred. Lipo oligosaccharide preparations from Rhizobium or Bradyrhizobium treated with flavonoids, known inducers of Nod factor synthesis, were up to 100 times more potent in inducing alkalinization than the ones from untreated bacteria. The activity was absent from preparations of the mutant strain Rhizobium sp. NGR234 Delta nodABC, unable to produce any Nod factors. Preparations of Nod factors from various bacteria as well as individual, highly purified Nod factors from Rhizobium sp. NGR(pA28) induced alkalinization in the tomato cell cultures at nanomolar concentrations. This demonstrates that Nod factors can be perceived by tomato; a nonhost of rhizobia. Using the alkalinization response as a sensitive bioassay, Nod factors were found to be inactivated by plant chitinases. Root chitinases purified from different legumes differed in their potential to inactivate differently substituted Nod factors produced by Rhizobium sp. NGR(pA28). This indicates that the specificity of the bacterium-host plant interaction may be due, at least in part, to differential inactivation of Nod factors by root chitinases.']","['rhizobium', 'rhizobial', 'bradyrhizobium', 'arabidopsis', 'legumes', 'plant', 'rhizobia', 'plants', 'legume', 'bacteria']",rhizobia,Rhizobia,Rhizobia,rhizobia,Rhizobium Interactions,Plant-Microbe Interactions,19
38,220,38_monkeys_primates_primate_monkey,"[""Lesser spot-nosed monkeys coordinate alarm call production with associated Campbell's monkeys Forest monkeys often form semi-permanent mixed-species associations to increase group-size related anti-predator benefits without corresponding increases in resource competition. In this study, we analysed the alarm call system of lesser spot-nosed monkeys, a primate that spends most of its time in mixed-species groups while occupying the lowest and presumably most dangerous part of the forest canopy. In contrast to other primate species, we found no evidence for predator-specific alarm calls. Instead, males gave one general alarm call type ('kroo') to three main dangers (i.e., crowned eagles, leopards and falling trees) and a second call type ('tcha-kow') as a coordinated response to calls produced in non-predatory contexts ('boom') by associated male Campbell's monkeys. Production of 'kroo' calls was also strongly affected by the alarm calling behaviour of male Campbell's monkeys, suggesting that male lesser spot-nosed monkeys adjust their alarm call production to another species' vocal behaviour. We discuss different hypotheses for this unusual phenomenon and propose that high predation pressure can lead to reliance on other species vocal behaviour to minimise predation. Significance statement Predation can lead to the evolution of acoustically distinct, predator-specific alarm calls. However, there are occasional reports of species lacking such abilities, despite diverse predation pressure, suggesting that evolutionary mechanisms are more complex. We conducted field experiments to systematically describe the alarm calling behaviour of lesser spot-nosed monkeys, an arboreal primate living in the lower forest strata where pressure from different predators is high. We found evidence for two acoustically distinct calls but, contrary to other primates in the same habitat, no evidence for predator-specific alarms. Instead, callers produced one alarm call type ('kroo') to all predator classes and another call type ('tcha-kow') to non-predatory dangers, but only as a response to a specific vocalisation of Campbell's monkeys ('boom'). The production of both calls was affected by the calling behaviour of Campbell's monkeys, suggesting that lesser spot-nosed monkey vocal behaviour is dependent on the antipredator behaviour of other species. Our study advances the theory of interspecies interactions and evolution of alarm calls."", ""A forest monkey's alarm call series to predator models Some non-human primates produce acoustically distinct alarm calls to different predators, such as eagles or leopards. Recipients respond to these calls as if they have seen the actual predator, which has led to the notion of functionally referential alarm calls. However, in a previous study with free-ranging putty-nosed monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans martini), we demonstrated that callers produced two acoustically distinct alarm calls to eagle shrieks and leopard growls, but both alarm calls were given to both predators. We can think of two basic explanations for this surprising result, a methodological and theoretical one. Firstly, acoustic predator models may not always be suitable to test alarm call behaviour in primates, sometimes causing uncharacteristic behaviour. Secondly, referential alarm calling may not be a universal feature of primate alarm call systems. Considering the methodological and theoretical importance of these possibilities, we conducted a follow-up study using life-sized leopard, eagle, and human models on the same population and compared the resulting vocal responses to those given to acoustic predator models. We compared the alarm call series given to each of these predator model types and found a considerable degree of consistency suggesting that the mode of presentation did not affect anti-predator calling strategies. However, evidence for audience effects on calling behaviour was inconclusive. While it appears that predator class is reliably encoded by different call series types irrespective of the mode of presentation, observations of these same call series given in non-predatory contexts indicate that predator class is unlikely to be the relevant organising principle underlying the alarm-calling behaviour in this species. We conclude by offering an alternative, non-referential, account of the alarm-calling system exhibited by this species."", 'Predation affects alarm call usage in female Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana diana) Diana monkeys produce acoustically distinct calls to a number of external events, including different types of predators. In a previous study, we found population-wide differences in male alarm call production in Ta < Forest, Ivory Coast, and on Tiwai Island, Sierra Leone, mostly likely originating from differences in predator experience. In Ta < Forest, leopards (Panthera pardus) are common but on Tiwai Island they have been absent for decades, while the predation pressure from crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) has been similar. To further evaluate the impact of predator experience, we here analyse the vocal behaviour of female Diana monkeys in both habitats. Female Diana monkeys produce predator-specific alarm calls, alert calls and contact calls in response to predators, suggesting that their calls serve in a broader range of functions compared to males. Results showed that females produced the same call types at both sites, despite the differences in predator fauna. Regarding call usage, leopard alarm calls were extremely rare on Tiwai Island, but not in Ta < Forest, whereas we found no differences in eagle alarm call production. When comparing response latencies, Tiwai females were slower to respond to both predators compared to Ta < females. Finally, we found no habitat-specific acoustic differences in the alert and predator-specific alarm calls, but significant differences in frequency-based parameters of contact calls. Overall, our results suggest that ontogenetic experience can affect primate vocal behaviour in both usage and acoustic structure but that the way in which particular call types are affected may be closely linked to function.']","['monkeys', 'primates', 'primate', 'monkey', 'chimpanzees', 'chimpanzee', 'leopards', 'leopard', 'predators', 'predator']",leopard,Primates,primates,leopard,Primate Predators,Primate Predators,19

Morphological evidence, direct isotopic dates(1) and fossil mitochondrial DNA from three Neanderthals(2,3) indicate that the Neanderthals were a separate evolutionary lineage for at least 500,000 yr. However, it is unknown when and how Neanderthal craniofacial autapomorphies (unique, derived characters) emerged during ontogeny. Here we use computerized fossil reconstruction(4) and geometric morphometrics (5,6) to show that characteristic differences in cranial and mandibular shape between Neanderthals and modern humans arose very early during development, possibly prenatally, and were maintained throughout postnatal ontogeny. Postnatal differences in cranial ontogeny between the two taxa are characterized primarily by heterochronic modifications of a common spatial pattern of development. Evidence for early ontogenetic divergence together with evolutionary stasis of taxon-specific patterns of ontogeny is consistent with separation of Neanderthals and modern humans at the species level."", ""Conserved relative timing of cranial ossification patterns in early mammalian evolution We analyzed a comprehensive data set of ossification sequences including seven marsupial, 13 placental and seven sauropsid species. Data are provided for the first time for two major mammalian clades, Chiroptera and Soricidae, and for two rodent species; the published sequences of three species were improved with additional sampling. The relative timing of the onset of ossification in 17 cranial elements was recorded, resulting in 136 event pairs, which were treated as characters for each species. Half of these characters are constant across all taxa, 30% are variable but phylogenetically uninformative, and 19% potentially deliver diagnostic features for clades of two or more taxa. Using the conservative estimate of heterochronic changes provided by the program Parsimov, only a few heterochronies were found to diagnose mammals, marsupials, or placentals. A later onset of ossification of the pterygoid with respect to six other cranial bones characterizes therian mammals. This result may relate to the relatively small size of this bone in this clade. One change in relative onset of ossification is hypothesized as a potential human autapomorphy in the context of the sampling made: the earlier onset of the ossification of the periotic with respect to the lacrimal and to three basicranial bones. Using the standard error of scaled ranks across all species as a measure of each element's lability in developmental timing, we found that ossification of early, middle, and late events are similarly labile, with basicranial traits the most labile in timing of onset of ossification. Despite marsupials and placental mammals diverging at least 130 Ma, few heterochronic shifts in cranial ossification diagnose these clades."", 'Ossification heterochrony in the therian postcranial skeleton and the marsupial-placental dichotomy Postcranial ossification sequences in 24therian mammals and three outgroup taxa were obtained using clearstaining and computed tomography to test the hypothesis that the marsupial forelimb is developmentally accelerated, and to assess patterns of therian postcranial ossification. Sequence rank variation of individual bones, phylogenetic analysis, and algorithm-based heterochrony optimization using event pairs were employed. Phylogenetic analysis only recovers Marsupialia, Australidelphia, and Eulipotyphla. Little heterochrony is found within marsupials and placentals. However, heterochrony was observed between marsupials and placentals, relating to late ossification in hind limb long bones and early ossification of the anterior axial skeleton. Also, ossification rank position of marsupial forelimb and shoulder girdle elements is more conservative than that of placentals; in placentals the hind limb area is more conservative. The differing ossification patterns in marsupials can be explained with a combination of muscular strain and energy allocation constraints, both resulting from the requirement of active movement of the altricial marsupial neonates toward the teat. Peramelemorphs, which are comparatively passive at birth and include species with relatively derived forelimbs, differ little from other marsupials in ossification sequence. This suggests that ossification heterochrony in marsupials is not directly related to diversity constraints on the marsupial forelimb and shoulder girdle.']","['evolutionary', 'phylogenetic', 'phylogeny', 'ontogenetic', 'evolution', 'marsupials', 'marsupial', 'mammals', 'fossils', 'ontogeny']",marsupials,Evolution,Evolution,marsupials,Evolutionary Biology,Evolutionary Biology,19

We focus on homogeneous birth death trees with incomplete sampling and consider observations from three distinct sampling schemes. First, individuals can be sampled and removed, through time, and included in the tree. Second, they can be occurrences which are sampled and removed through time and not included in the tree. Third, extant individuals can be sampled and included in the tree. The outcome of the process is thus composed of the reconstructed phylogenetic tree spanning all individuals sampled and included in the tree, and a time-line of occurrence events which are not placed along the tree. We derive a formula for computing the joint probability density of this outcome, which can readily be used to perform maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation of the parameters of the model. In the context of epidemiology, our probability density enables the estimation of transmission rates through a joint analysis of epidemiological case count data and phylogenetic trees reconstructed from pathogen sequences. Within macroevolution, our equations form the basis for incorporating fossil occurrences from paleontological databases together with extant species phylogenies for estimating speciation and extinction rates. This work provides the theoretical framework for bridging not only the gap between phylogenetics and epidemiology, but also that between phylogenetics and paleontology. (C) 2020  Ltd.

We show that G(LInv), contains the vast majority of Gaussian models currently used in PCMs, while supporting an efficient (linear in the number of nodes) algorithm for the likelihood calculation. The algorithm supports scenarios with missing data, as well as different types of trees, including trees with polytomies and non-ultrametric trees. To account for the heterogeneity in the evolutionary forces, the algorithm supports models with ""shifts"" occurring at specific points in the tree. Such shifts can include changes in some or all parameters, as well as the type of the model, provided that the model remains within the G(LInv) family. This contrasts with most of the current implementations where, due to slow likelihood calculation, the shifts are restricted to specific parameters in a single type of model, such as the long-term selection optima of an OU process, assuming that all of its other parameters, such as evolutionary rate and selection strength, are global for the entire tree. Phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have been used to study the evolution of quantitative traits in various groups of organisms, ranging from micro-organisms to animal and plant species. A common approach has been to assume a Gaussian phylogenetic model for the trait evolution along the tree, such as a branching Brownian motion (BM) or an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. Then, the parameters of the process have been inferred based on a given tree and trait data for the sampled species. At the heart of this inference lie multiple calculations of the model likelihood, that is, the probability density of the observed trait data, conditional on the model parameters and the tree. With the increasing availability of big phylogenetic trees, spanning hundreds to several thousand sampled species, this approach is facing a two-fold challenge. First, the assumption of a single Gaussian process governing the entire tree is not adequate in the presence of heterogeneous evolutionary forces acting in different parts of the tree. Second, big trees present a computational challenge, due to the time and memory complexity of the model likelihood calculation. We provide an implementation of this likelihood calculation algorithm in an accompanying R-package called PCMBase. The package has been designed as a generic library that can be integrated with existing or novel maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference tools. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Furthermore, speciation and extinction rates and their posterior credibility intervals can be estimated while accounting for non-random taxon sampling. The framework is particularly suitable for hypothesis testing using Bayes factors, as we demonstrate analyzing dated phylogenies of Chondrostoma (Cyprinidae) and Lupinus (Fabaceae). In addition, we develop a model that extends the rate estimation to a meta-analysis framework in which different data sets are combined in a single analysis to detect general temporal and spatial trends in diversification. Background: Patterns of species diversity are the result of speciation and extinction processes, and molecular phylogenetic data can provide valuable information to derive their variability through time and across clades. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods offer a promising framework to incorporate phylogenetic uncertainty when estimating rates of diversification. Conclusions: Our approach provides a flexible framework for the estimation of diversification parameters and hypothesis testing while simultaneously accounting for uncertainties in the divergence times and incomplete taxon sampling.']","['phylogenetic', 'phylogenies', 'evolutionary', 'evolution', 'extinction', 'species', 'likelihood', 'statistical', 'macroevolutionary', 'models']",biology,Evolutionary,Phylogenetics,biology,Phylogenetic Evolution,Phylogenetic Evolution,19

In an attempt to identify relevant M protein domains involved in viral assembly and budding, a series of deletion mutants were tested for their ability to bind to cellular membrane fractions. The deletion of a region spanning amino acids 105-137 significantly decreased this binding when the protein was expressed in a system driven by the T7 RNA polymerase away from any other viral proteins. Plus or minus charges were introduced in the hydrophobic portion of a predicted amphiphilic helix in this region, and M proteins with altered membrane binding properties were produced. The genes encoding these mutant M proteins were then inserted in the Sendai virus vector and shown to be expressed at levels similar to that of the endogenous wild-type M protein. The presence of a negative charge in the hydrophobic region of the putative amphiphilic helix prevented the incorporation of the mutant protein into virus particles and appeared to decrease the efficiency of virus particle budding. In contrast, the introduction of a positive charge appeared to increase the M mutant uptake into virions. The use a Sendai virus vector has therefore been shown instrumental in the identification of mutant M proteins interfering with the viral assembly-budding process.

All rights reserved.', 'NMR DETERMINATION OF THE SECONDARY STRUCTURE AND THE 3-DIMENSIONAL POLYPEPTIDE BACKBONE FOLD OF THE HUMAN STEROL CARRIER PROTEIN-2 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structure and the three-dimensional polypeptide backbone fold of the human sterol carrier protein 2 (hSCP2), which is a basic protein with 123 residues believed to participate in the intracellular transport of cholesterol and various other lipids. Sequence-specific assignments were obtained for nearly all backbone H-1 and N-15 resonances, as well as for about two-thirds of the side-chain H-1 resonances, using uniform N-15-labeling of the protein combined with homonuclear two-dimensional H-1 NMR and three-dimensional N-15-correlated H-1 NMR. Three a-helices comprising the polypeptide segments of residues 9-22, 25-30 and 78-84 were identified by sequential and medium-range nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE). The analysis of long-range backbone-backbone NOEs showed that hSCP2 further contains a five-stranded P-sheet including the residues 33-41, 47-54, 60-62, 71-76 and 100-102, which is a central feature of the molecular architecture. The first three strands are arranged in an antiparallel fashion, the polypeptide chain then crosses over this three-stranded sheet in a right-handed sense so that the fourth strand is added parallel to the first one. The fifth strand runs antiparallel to the fourth one, so that the overall topology is +1, +1, -3x, -1. The three-dimensional arrangement of the beta-sheet and the first two helices was determined using an input of 625 NOE upper distance constraints and 95 scalar coupling constants for a preliminary structure calculation with the distance geometry program DIANA.', 'Transverse relaxation-optimized NMR spectroscopy with the outer membrane protein OmpX in dihexanoyl phosphatidylcholine micelles The H-2,C-13,N-15-labeled, 148-residue integral membrane protein OmpX from Escherichia coli was reconstituted with dihexanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DHPC) in mixed micelles of molecular mass of about 60 kDa. Transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)-type triple resonance NMR experiments and TROSY-type nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectra were recorded in 2 mM aqueous solutions of these mixed micelles at pH 6.8 and 30 degreesC. Complete sequence-specific NMR assignments for the polypeptide backbone thus have been obtained. The C-13 chemical shifts and the nuclear Overhauser effect data then resulted in the identification of the regular secondary structure elements of OmpX/DHPC in solution and in the collection of an input of conformational constraints for the computation of the global fold of the protein. The same type of polypeptide backbone fold is observed in the presently determined solution structure and the previously reported crystal structure of OmpX determined in the presence of the detergent n-octyltetraoxyethylene. Further structure refinement will have to rely on the additional resonance assignment of partially or fully protonated amino acid side chains, but the present data already demonstrate that relaxation-optimized NMR techniques open novel avenues for studies of structure and function of integral membrane proteins.']","['molecular', 'spectroscopy', 'proteins', 'resonances', 'protein', 'resonance', 'amino', 'nmr', 'proton', 'chemical']",biology,Spectroscopy,NMR,biology,NMR Spectroscopy,Protein NMR Spectroscopy,19

The N-glycosylation process includes two principal phases: the assembly of a lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) and the transfer of the oligosaccharide to selected asparagine residues of polypeptide chains. Biosynthesis of the LLO takes place at both sides of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and it involves a series of specific glycosyltransferases that catalyze the assembly of the branched oligosaccharide in a highly defined way. Oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) selects the Asn-X-Ser/Thr consensus sequence on polypeptide chains and generates the N-glycosidic linkage between the side-chain amide of asparagine and the oligosaccharide. This ER-localized pathway results in a systemic modification of the proteome, the basis for the Golgi-catalyzed modification of the N-linked glycans, generating the large diversity of N-glycoproteome in eukaryotic cells. This article focuses on the processes in the ER. Based on the highly conserved nature of this pathway we concentrate on the mechanisms in the eukaryotic model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae.', 'Oligosaccharyltransferase: the central enzyme of N-linked protein glycosylation N-linked glycosylation is one of the most abundant modifications of proteins in eukaryotic organisms. In the central reaction of the pathway, oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), a multimeric complex located at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, transfers a preassembled oligosaccharide to selected asparagine residues within the consensus sequence asparagine-X-serine/threonine. Due to the high substrate specificity of OST, alterations in the biosynthesis of the oligosaccharide substrate result in the hypoglycosylation of many different proteins and a multitude of symptoms observed in the family of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) type I. This review covers our knowledge of human OST and describes enzyme composition. The Stt3 subunit of OST harbors the catalytic center of the enzyme, but the function of the other, highly conserved, subunits are less well defined. Some components seem to be involved in the recognition and utilization of glycosylation sites in specific glycoproteins. Indeed, mutations in the subunit paralogs N33/Tusc3 and IAP do not yield the pleiotropic phenotypes typical for CDG type I but specifically result in nonsyndromic mental retardation, suggesting that the oxidoreductase activity of these subunits is required for glycosylation of a subset of proteins essential for brain development.', 'Quantitative Profiling of N-linked Glycosylation Machinery in Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Asparagine-linked glycosylation is a common posttranslational protein modification regulating the structure, stability and function of many proteins. The N-linked glycosylation machinery involves enzymes responsible for the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), which is then transferred to the asparagine residues on the polypeptides by the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase (OST). A major goal in the study of protein glycosylation is to establish quantitative methods for the analysis of site-specific extent of glycosylation. We developed a sensitive approach to examine glycosylation site occupancy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by coupling stable isotope labeling (SILAC) approach to parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry (MS). We combined the method with genetic tools and validated the approach with the identification of novel glycosylation sites dependent on the Ost3p and Ost6p regulatory subunits of OST. Based on the observations that alternations in LLO substrate structure and OST subunits activity differentially alter the systemic output of OST, we conclude that sequon recognition is a direct property of the catalytic subunit Stt3p, auxiliary subunits such as Ost3p and Ost6p extend the OST substrate range by modulating interfering pathways such as protein folding. In addition, our proteomics approach revealed a novel regulatory network that connects isoprenoid lipid biosynthesis and LLO substrate assembly.']","['glycosyltransferase', 'oligosaccharyltransferase', 'glycoproteins', 'glycoprotein', 'oligosaccharides', 'oligosaccharide', 'glycosylation', 'galactosyltransferase', 'enzyme', 'proteins']",glycosyltransferase,Glycosylation,Glycosylation,glycosyltransferase,Glycosylation Enzymes,Protein Glycosylation,19

We have identified a novel class of functional 23- to 25-nt long-miRNAs that is generated independently from the same miRNA precursors by DCL3. Long-miRNAs are developmentally regulated and in some cases have been conserved during evolution implying that they have biological functions. Plant microRNA genes (MIR) have been proposed to evolve by inverted duplication of the target gene. We found that recently evolved MIR genes consistently give rise to long-miRNAs, while ancient MIR genes give rise predominantly to canonical miRNAs. Transcripts from inverted repeats representing evolving proto-MIR genes were processed by DCL3 into long-miRNAs and also by DCL1, DCL2 or DCL4 depending on hairpin stem length to produce different sizes of miRNAs. Our results suggest that evolution of MIR genes is associated with gradual, overlapping changes in DCL usage resulting in specific size classes of miRNAs.', ""Cell-type-specific signatures of microRNAs on target mRNA expression Although it is known that the human genome contains hundreds of microRNA (miRNA) genes and that each miRNA can regulate a large number of mRNA targets, the overall effect of miRNAs on mRNA tissue profiles has not been systematically elucidated. Here, we show that predicted human mRNA targets of several highly tissue-specific miRNAs are typically expressed in the same tissue as the miRNA but at significantly lower levels than in tissues where the miRNA is not present. Conversely, highly expressed genes are often enriched in mRNAs that do not have the recognition motifs for the miRNAs expressed in these tissues. Together, our data support the hypothesis that miRNA expression broadly contributes to tissue specificity of mRNA expression in many human tissues. Based on these insights, we apply a computational tool to directly correlate 3' UTR motifs with changes in mRNA levels upon miRNA overexpression or knockdown. We show that this tool can identify functionally important 3' UTR motifs without cross-species comparison."", 'Single-cell mRNA profiling reveals the hierarchical response of miRNA targets to miRNA induction miRNAs are small RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. By repressing the translation and promoting the degradation of target mRNAs, miRNAs may reduce the cell-to-cell variability in protein expression, induce correlations between target expression levels, and provide a layer through which targets can influence each other\'s expression as ""competing RNAs"" (ceRNAs). However, experimental evidence for these behaviors is limited. Combining mathematical modeling with RNA sequencing of individual human embryonic kidney cells in which the expression of two distinct miRNAs was induced over a wide range, we have inferred parameters describing the response of hundreds of miRNA targets to miRNA induction. Individual targets have widely different response dynamics, and only a small proportion of predicted targets exhibit high sensitivity to miRNA induction. Our data reveal for the first time the response parameters of the entire network of endogenous miRNA targets to miRNA induction, demonstrating that miRNAs correlate target expression and at the same time increase the variability in expression of individual targets across cells. The approach is generalizable to other miRNAs and post-transcriptional regulators to improve the understanding of gene expression dynamics in individual cell types.']","['micrornas', 'microrna', 'mir155', 'genes', 'transcriptional', 'gene', 'rnas', 'transcripts', 'viral', 'rna']",gene,MicroRNAs,microRNAs,gene,MicroRNA Regulation,MicroRNA Regulation,19
45,203,45_neurotransmitter_synapses_synaptic_neuronal,"['A mechanism intrinsic to the vesicle fusion machinery determines fast and slow transmitter release at a large CNS synapse Heterogeneity of release probability p between vesicles in the readily releasable pool (RRP) is expected to strongly influence the kinetics of depression at synapses, but the underlying mechanism(s) are not well understood. To test whether differences in the intrinsic Ca2+ sensitivity of vesicle fusion might cause heterogeneity of p, we made presynaptic Ca2+-uncaging measurements at the calyx of Held and analyzed the time course of transmitter release by EPSC deconvolution. Ca2+ uncaging, which produced spatially homogeneous elevations of [Ca2+](i), evoked a fast and a slow component of release over a wide range of [Ca2+](i), showing that mechanism(s) intrinsic to the vesicle fusion machinery cause fast and slow transmitter release. Surprisingly, the number of vesicles released in the fast component increased with Ca2+-uncaging stimuli of larger amplitudes, a finding that was most obvious below similar to 10 mu M [Ca2+](i) and that we call ""submaximal release"" of fast-releasable vesicles. During trains of action potential-like presynaptic depolarizations, submaximal release was also observed as an increase in the cumulative fast release at enhanced release probabilities. A model that assumes two separate subpools of RRP vesicles with different intrinsic Ca2+ sensitivities predicted the observed Ca2+ dependencies of fast and slow transmitter release but could not fully account for submaximal release. Thus, fast and slow transmitter release in response to prolonged [Ca2(+)](i) elevations is caused by intrinsic differences between RRP vesicles, and an ""a posteriori"" reduction of the Ca2+ sensitivity of vesicle fusion after the onset of the stimulus might cause submaximal release of fast-releasable vesicles and contribute to short-term synaptic depression.', ""Allosteric modulation of the presynaptic Ca2+ sensor for vesicle fusion Neurotransmitter release is triggered by an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)), but it is unknown whether the Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion is modulated during synaptic plasticity. We investigated whether the potentiation of neurotransmitter release by phorbol esters(1-3), which target presynaptic protein kinase C (PKC)/munc-13 signalling cascades(4-6), exerts a direct effect on the Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion. Using direct presynaptic Ca2+-manipulation and Ca2+ uncaging at a giant presynaptic terminal, the calyx of Held, we show that phorbol esters potentiate transmitter release by increasing the apparent Ca2+-sensitivity of vesicle fusion. Phorbol esters potentiate Ca2+-evoked release as well as the spontaneous release rate. We explain both effects by an increased fusion 'willingness' in a new allosteric model of Ca2+-activation of vesicle fusion. In agreement with an allosteric mechanism, we observe that the classically high Ca2+ cooperativity in triggering vesicle fusion (similar to 4) is gradually reduced below 3 mu M [Ca2+](i), reaching a value of &lt; 1 at basal [Ca2+](i). Our data indicate that spontaneous transmitter release close to resting [Ca2+](i) is a consequence of an intrinsic property of the molecular machinery(7,8) that mediates synaptic vesicle fusion."", 'Intracellular calcium dependence of transmitter release rates at a fast central synapse Calcium-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitter release are fundamental signalling steps in the central nervous system. It is generally assumed that fast transmitter release is triggered by elevations in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i)) to at least 100 mu M near the sites of vesicle fusion(1-5). For synapses in the central nervous system, however, there are no experimental estimates of this local [Ca2+](i) signal. Here we show, by using calcium ion uncaging in the large synaptic terminals of the calyx of Held, that step-like elevations to only 10 mu M [Ca2+](i) induce fast transmitter release, which depletes around 80% of a pool of available vesicles in less than 3 ms. Kinetic analysis of transmitter release rates after [Ca2+](i) steps revealed the rate constants for calcium binding and vesicle fusion. These show that transient (around 0.5 ms) local elevations of [Ca2+](i) to peak values as low as 25 mu M can account for transmitter release during single presynaptic action potentials. The calcium sensors for vesicle fusion are far from saturation at normal release probability. This non-saturation, and the high intracellular calcium cooperativity in triggering vesicle fusion, make fast synaptic transmission very sensitive to modulation by changes in local [Ca2+](i).']","['neurotransmitter', 'synapses', 'synaptic', 'neuronal', 'synapse', 'neurons', 'signaling', 'receptors', 'hippocampal', 'hippocampus']",biology,Neurotransmission,Neurotransmission,biology,Neurotransmitter Signaling,Synaptic Signaling,19

In particular, we describe the neuronal composition of three external and three pharyngeal chemosensory organs, the nerve tracts chosen by their afferents, and their central target regions. With a total of 21 olfactory and 80 gustatory neurons, the sensory level is numerically much simpler than that of the adult. Moreover, its design is different than in the adult, showing an association between smell and taste sensilla. In contrast, the first-order relay of the olfactory afferents, the larval antennal lobe (LAL), exhibits adult-like features both in terms of structure and cell number. It shows a division into approximately 30 subunits, reminiscent of glomeruli in the adult antennal lobe. Taken together, the design of the larval chemosensory system is a ""hybrid,"" with larval-specific features in the periphery and central characteristics in common with the adult. The largely reduced numbers of afferents and the similar architecture of the LAL and the adult antennal lobe, render the larval chemosensory system of Drosophila a valuable model system, both for studying smell and taste and for examining the development of its adult organization. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.', 'Calcium Imaging of Odor-evoked Responses in the Drosophila Antennal Lobe Optical imaging of the activity of OSNs, LNs and PNs in the antennal lobe - traditionally using synthetic calcium indicators (e.g. calcium green, FURA-2) or voltage-sensitive dyes (e.g. RH414) - has long been an important technique to understand how olfactory stimuli are represented as spatial and temporal patterns of glomerular activity in many species of insects(6-10). Development of genetically-encoded neural activity reporters, such as the fluorescent calcium indicators G-CaMP11,12 and Cameleon(13), the bioluminescent calcium indicator GFP-aequorin(14,15), or a reporter of synaptic transmission, synapto-pHluorin(16) has made the olfactory system of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, particularly accessible to neurophysiological imaging, complementing its comprehensively-described molecular, electrophysiological and neuroanatomical properties(2,4,17). These reporters can be selectively expressed via binary transcriptional control systems (e. g. GAL4/UAS(18), LexA/LexAop(19,20), Q system(21)) in defined populations of neurons within the olfactory circuitry to dissect with high spatial and temporal resolution how odor-evoked neural activity is represented, modulated and transformed(22-24). The antennal lobe is the primary olfactory center in the insect brain and represents the anatomical and functional equivalent of the vertebrate olfactory bulb(1-5). Olfactory information in the external world is transmitted to the antennal lobe by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), which segregate to distinct regions of neuropil called glomeruli according to the specific olfactory receptor they express. Here, OSN axons synapse with both local interneurons (LNs), whose processes can innervate many different glomeruli, and projection neurons (PNs), which convey olfactory information to higher olfactory brain regions. Here we describe the preparation and analysis methods to measure odor-evoked responses in the Drosophila antennal lobe using G-CaMP25-27. The animal preparation is minimally invasive and can be adapted to imaging using wide-field fluorescence, confocal and two-photon microscopes.', ""Target neuron prespecification in the olfactory map of Drosophila In Drosophila and mice, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing the same receptors have convergent axonal projections to specific glomerular targets in the antennal lobe/olfactory bulb, creating an odour map in this first olfactory structure of the central nervous system(1-3). Projection neurons of the Drosophila antennal lobe send dendrites into glomeruli and axons to higher brain centres(4), thereby transferring this odour map further into the brain. Here we use the MARCM method(5) to perform a systematic clonal analysis of projection neurons, allowing us to correlate lineage and birth time of projection neurons with their glomerular choice. We demonstrate that projection neurons are prespecified by lineage and birth order to form a synapse with specific incoming ORN axons, and therefore to carry specific olfactory information. This prespecification could be used to hardwire the fly's olfactory system, enabling stereotyped behavioural responses to odorants. Developmental studies lead us to hypothesize that recognition molecules ensure reciprocally specific connections of ORNs and projection neurons. These studies also imply a previously unanticipated role for precise dendritic targeting by postsynaptic neurons in determining connection specificity.""]","['neuronal', 'neurons', 'neuron', 'olfactory', 'neuroblasts', 'neural', 'synaptic', 'brain', 'neuroblast', 'chemosensory']",biology,Neurobiology,neuroscience,neuron,Neural Development,Neuronal System,19

The aim of this study was to assess Plasmodium falciparum infection, malaria-related morbidity, use of preventive measures and treatment against malaria, and physical access to health structures among school-aged children across Cote d'Ivoire. Methods: A national, cross-sectional study was designed, consisting of clinical and parasitological examinations and interviews with schoolchildren. More than 5,000 children from 93 schools in Cote d'Ivoire were interviewed to determine household socioeconomic status, self-reported morbidity and means of malaria prevention and treatment. Finger-prick blood samples were collected and Plasmodium infection and parasitaemia determined using Giemsa-stained blood films and a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Haemoglobin levels and body temperature were measured. Children were classified into wealth quintiles using household assets and principal components analysis (PCA). The concentration index was employed to determine significant trends of health variables according to wealth quintiles. Logistic and binomial negative regression analyses were done to investigate for associations between P. falciparum prevalence and parasitaemia and any health-related variable. Conclusion: Seven out of ten school-aged children in Cote d'Ivoire are infected with P. falciparum and malaria-related morbidity is considerable. Furthermore, this study points out that bed net usage is quite low and there are important inequalities in preventive measures and treatment. These results can guide equity-oriented malaria control strategies in Cote d'Ivoire. Results: The prevalence of P. falciparum was 73.9% according to combined microscopy and RDT results with a geometric mean of parasitaemia among infected children of 499 parasites/mu l of blood. Infection with P. falciparum was significantly associated with sex, socioeconomic status and study setting, while parasitaemia was associated with age. The rate of bed net use was low compared to the rate of bed net ownership. Preventive measures (bed net ownership, insecticide spray and the reported use of malaria treatment) were more frequently mentioned by children from wealthier households who were at lower risk of P. falciparum infection. Self-reported morbidity (headache) and clinical morbidity (anaemia) were more often reported by children from less wealthy households."", 'IS FEVER A GOOD SIGN FOR CLINICAL MALARIA IN SURVEYS OF ENDEMIC COMMUNITIES Although fever is the characteristic sign of clinical malaria, many Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases in endemic areas do not present with measurable temperature elevations. In a field study in Tanzania, malaria morbidity was defined to be any current self- or parentally reported illness associated with malaria parasite densities higher than those in healthy individuals. Without diagnosis of individual episodes, prevalences of malaria-attributable morbidity of 9.8% in infants, 1.3% in children 1-4 years of age, and 0.6% in those 5-9 years of age were estimated. No illness was considered to be due to malaria in older individuals. In infants, 66.5% of malaria-attributable morbidity episodes corresponded to axillary temperatures &lt; 37.5 degrees C. In older children, most of the episodes due to malaria corresponded to increased temperatures. This age dependence should be considered when designing diagnostic procedures and outcome measures for epidemiologic studies of malaria.', 'Rapid Urban Malaria Appraisal (RUMA) IV: Epidemiology of urban malaria in Cotonou (Benin) Results: The field work was carried out in February-March 2003. In 2002 and out of 289,342 consultations in the public health facilities of Cotonou there were 100,257 reported simple malaria cases (34.6%) and 12,195 complicated malaria cases (4.2%). In the school parasitaemia surveys, a malaria infection was found in 5.2% of all samples. The prevalence rates of parasitaemia in the centre, intermediate and periphery zones were 2.6%, 9.0% and 2.5%, respectively. In the health facility surveys the malaria infection rates in presenting fever cases were 0% ( under one year old), 6.8% ( one to five years old), 0% (&gt; five to 15 years old) and 0.9% ( over 15 years old), while these rates in the control group were 1.4%, 2.8%, 1.3% and 2.0%. The malaria-attributable fractions among presenting fever cases were 0.04 in the one to five years old and zero in the three other age groups. Hence, malaria played only a small role in fever episodes at the end of the dry season. In total, 69.2% of patients used a mosquito net the night before the survey and 35.1% used an insecticide-treated net, which was shown to be protective for an infection ( OR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 - 0.78). Travelling to a rural area (5.8% of all respondents) did not increase the infection risk. Conclusion: The homogenously low malaria prevalence might be associated with urban transformation and/or a high bednet usage. Over-diagnosis of malaria and over-treatment with antimalarials was found to be a serious problem. Methods: A health care system evaluation and a series of school parasitaemia surveys and health facility-based surveys were carried out during the dry season in of 2003, applying standard Rapid Urban Malaria Appraisal (RUMA) methodology. This study was part of a multi-site assessment supported by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership. Background: An estimated 40 % of the population in Benin lives in urban areas.

This theory assumes that host genetic diversity results in variation in susceptibility and that parasites exhibit variation in infectivity. Empirical studies on the effects of host heterogeneity typically neglect the role of parasite diversity. We conducted three laboratory experiments designed to test if genetic variation in Daphnia magna populations and genetic variation in its parasites together influence the course of parasite spread after introduction. We found that a natural D. magna population exhibited variation in susceptibility to infection by three parasite species and had strong host clone parasite species interactions. There was no effect of host heterogeneity in experimental host populations (polycultures and monocultures) separately exposed to single strains of three parasite species. When we manipulated the genetic diversity of a single parasite species and exposed them to host monocultures and polycultures, we found that parasite prevalence increased with the number of parasite strains. Host monocultures exposed to several parasite strains had higher mean parasite prevalence and higher variance than polycultures. These results indicate that effect of host genetic diversity on the spread of infection depends on the level of genetic diversity in the parasite population.', 'Within- and between-population variation for resistance of Daphnia magna to the bacterial endoparasite Pasteuria ramosa Genetic variation among hosts for resistance to parasites is an important assumption underlying evolutionary theory of host and parasite evolution. Using the castrating bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa and its cladoceran host Daphnia magna, we examined both within- and between-population genetic variation for resistance. First, we tested hosts from four populations for genetic variation for resistance to three parasite isolates. Allozyme analysis revealed significant host population divergence and that genetic distance corresponds to geographic distance. Host and parasite fitness components showed strong genetic differences between parasite isolates for host population by parasite interactions and for clones within populations, whereas host population effects were significant for only a few traits. In a second experiment we tested explicitly for within-population differences in variation for resistance by challenging nine host clones from a single population with four different parasite spore doses. Strong clone and dose effects were evident. More susceptible clones also suffered higher costs once infected. The results indicate that within-population variation for resistance is high relative to between-population variation. We speculate that P. ramosa adapts to individual host clones rather than to its host population.', 'Disentangling the influence of parasite genotype, host genotype and maternal environment on different stages of bacterial infection in Daphnia magna Individuals naturally vary in the severity of infectious disease when exposed to a parasite. Dissecting this variation into genetic and environmental components can reveal whether or not this variation depends on the host genotype, parasite genotype or a range of environmental conditions. Complicating this task, however, is that the symptoms of disease result from the combined effect of a series of events, from the initial encounter between a host and parasite, through to the activation of the host immune system and the exploitation of host resources. Here, we use the crustacean Daphnia magna and its parasite Pasteuria ramosa to show how disentangling genetic and environmental factors at different stages of infection improves our understanding of the processes shaping infectious disease. Using compatible host-parasite combinations, we experimentally exclude variation in the ability of a parasite to penetrate the host, from measures of parasite clearance, the reduction in host fecundity and the proliferation of the parasite. We show how parasite resistance consists of two components that vary in environmental sensitivity, how the maternal environment influences all measured aspects of the within-host infection process and how host-parasite interactions following the penetration of the parasite into the host have a distinct temporal component.']","['parasite', 'parasites', 'pathogens', 'pathogen', 'species', 'genotypes', 'evolutionary', 'infectivity', 'genotype', 'epidemics']",pathogens,Pathogens,Infectiousness,pathogens,Parasite Evolution,Parasite Evolution,19

These stem cells give rise to new olfactory neurons that are renewed throughout life. The neurons originate in the subventricular zone (SVZ), migrate within the rostral extension (RE) of the SVZ along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) within tube-like structures formed of glial cells, to eventually reach the olfactory bulb (OB). We demonstrate that, contrary to the current view, multipotential (neuronal-astroglial-oligodendroglial) precursors with stem cell features can be isolated not only from the SVZ but also from the entire RE, including the distal portion within the OB. Specifically, these stem cells do not derive from the migratory neuroblasts coming from the SVZ. Interestingly, stem cells isolated from the proximal RE generate significantly more oligodendrocytes, and those from the distal RE proliferate significantly more slowly than stem cells derived from the SVZ and other RE regions. These findings demonstrate that stem cells are not confined to the forebrain periventricular region and indicate that stem cells endowed with different functional characteristics occur at different levels of the SVZ-RE pathway.', 'Regional and Stage-Specific Effects of Prospectively Purified Vascular Cells on the Adult V-SVZ Neural Stem Cell Lineage Adult neural stem cells reside in specialized niches. In the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), quiescent neural stem cells (qNSCs) become activated (aNSCs), and generate transit amplifying cells (TACs), which give rise to neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory bulb. The vasculature is an important component of the adult neural stem cell niche, but whether vascular cells in neurogenic areas are intrinsically different from those elsewhere in the brain is unknown. Moreover, the contribution of pericytes to the neural stem cell niche has not been defined. Here, we describe a rapid FACS purification strategy to simultaneously isolate primary endothelial cells and pericytes from brain microregions of nontransgenic mice using CD31 and CD13 as surface markers. We compared the effect of purified vascular cells from a neurogenic (V-SVZ) and non-neurogenic brain region (cortex) on the V-SVZ stem cell lineage in vitro. Endothelial and pericyte diffusible signals from both regions differentially promote the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of qNSCs, aNSCs, and TACs. Unexpectedly, diffusible cortical signals had the most potent effects on V-SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis, highlighting the intrinsic capacity of non-neurogenic vasculature to support stem cell behavior. Finally, we identify PlGF-2 as an endothelial-derived mitogen that promotes V-SVZ cell proliferation. This purification strategy provides a platform to define the functional and molecular contribution of vascular cells to stem cell niches and other brain regions under different physiological and pathological states.', 'Lineage analysis of quiescent regenerative stem cells in the adult brain by genetic labelling reveals spatially restricted neurogenic niches in the olfactory bulb The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles is the major neurogenic region in the adult mammalian brain, harbouring neural stem cells within defined niches. The identity of these stem cells and the factors regulating their fate are poorly understood. We have genetically mapped a population of Nestin-expressing cells during postnatal development to study their potential and fate in vivo. Taking advantage of the recombination characteristics of a nestin::CreER(T2) allele, we followed a subpopulation of neural stem cells and traced their fate in a largely unrecombined neurogenic niche. Perinatal nestin::CreER(T2)-expressing cells give rise to multiple glial cell types and neurons, as well as to stem cells of the adult SVZ. In the adult SVZ nestin::CreER(T2)-expressing neural stem cells give rise to several neuronal subtypes in the olfactory bulb (OB). We addressed whether the same population of neural stem cells play a role in SVZ regeneration. Following anti-mitotic treatment to eliminate rapidly dividing progenitors, relatively quiescent nestin::CreER(T2)-targeted cells are spared and contribute to SVZ regeneration, generating new proliferating precursors and neuroblasts.

These OB-RMS progenitors generate neuroblasts that, upon transplantation, graft, migrate and differentiate into granule and glomerular neurons.

Protein fluorescence, crosslinking and kinetic analysis revealed that the bond between the two otherwise thermoresistant oligomers is regulated by temperature. As temperature increased, the affinity of GroES(7) and the release of bound proteins from the chaperonin concomitantly decreased. After heat shock, GroES(7) rebinding to GroEL(14) and GroEL(14)GroES(7) particles correlated with the restoration of optimal protein folding/release activity. Chaperonins thus behave as a molecular thermometer which can inhibit the release of aggregation-prone proteins during heat shock and restore protein folding and release after heat shock. (C) 1997 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.', 'Temperature-controlled activity of DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperones: Protein-folding arrest and recovery during and after heat shock depends on the substrate protein and the GrpE concentration Heat-shock proteins DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE (KJE) from Escherichia coli constitute a three-component chaperone system that prevents aggregation of denatured proteins and assists the refolding of proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. We found that the rate of KJE-mediated refolding of heat- and chemically denatured proteins is decreased at high temperatures. The efficiency and reversibility of protein-folding arrest during and after heat shock depended on the stability of the complex between KJE and the denatured proteins. Whereas a thermostable protein was released and partially refolded during heat shock, a thermolabile protein remained bound to the chaperone. The apparent affinity of GrpE and DnaJ for DnaK was decreased at high temperatures, thereby decreasing futile consumption of ATP during folding arrest. The coupling of ATP hydrolysis and protein folding was restored after the stress. This strongly indicates that KJE chaperones are heat-regulated heat-shock proteins which can specifically arrest the folding of aggregation-prone proteins during stress and preferentially resume refolding under conditions that allow individual proteins to reach and maintain a stable native conformation.', 'Chemical chaperones regulate molecular chaperones in vitro and in cells under combined salt and heat stresses Salt and heat stresses, which are often combined in nature, induce complementing defense mechanisms. Organisms adapt to high external salinity by accumulating small organic compounds known as osmolytes, which equilibrate cellular osmotic pressure. Osmolytes can also act as ""chemical chaperones"" by increasing the stability of native proteins and assisting refolding of unfolded polypeptides. Adaptation to heat stress depends on the expression of heat-shock proteins, many of which are molecular chaperones, that prevent protein aggregation, disassemble protein aggregates, and assist protein refolding. We show here that Escherichia coli cells preadapted to high salinity contain increased levels of glycine betaine that prevent protein aggregation under thermal stress. After heat shock, the aggregated proteins, which escaped protection, were disaggregated in salt-adapted cells as efficiently as in low salt. Here we address the effects of four common osmolytes on chaperone activity in vitro. Systematic dose responses of glycine betaine, glycerol, proline, and trehalose revealed a regulatory effect on the folding activities of individual and combinations of chaperones GroEL, DnaK, and ClpB. With the exception of trehalose, low physiological concentrations of proline, glycerol, and especially glycine betaine activated the molecular chaperones, likely by assisting local folding in chaperone-bound polypeptides and stabilizing the native end product of the reaction. High osmolyte concentrations, especially trehalose, strongly inhibited DnaK-dependent chaperone networks, such as DnaK+GroEL and DnaK+ClpB, likely because high viscosity affects dynamic interactions between chaperones and folding substrates and stabilizes protein aggregates. Thus, during combined salt and heat stresses, cells can specifically control protein stability and chaperone-mediated disaggregation and refolding by modulating the intracellular levels of different osmolytes.']","['thermotolerance', 'molecular', 'proteins', 'protein', 'thermostability', 'heat', 'chaperonin', 'mechanism', 'chaperones', 'coli']",coli,Thermotolerance,Thermotolerance,coli,Thermotolerance Mechanisms,Protein Thermostability,19

In particular, integration of bodily signals within the peripersonal space (PPS) underlies the experience of the self in a body we own (self-identification) and that is experienced as occupying a specific location in space (self-location), two main components of bodily self-consciousness (BSC). Experiments investigating the effects of multisensory integration on BSC have typically employed supra-threshold sensory stimuli, neglecting the role of unconscious sensory signals in BSC, as tested in other consciousness research. Here, we used psychophysical techniques to test whether multisensory integration of bodily stimuli underlying BSC also occurs for multisensory inputs presented below the threshold of conscious perception. Our results indicate that visual stimuli rendered invisible through continuous flash suppression boost processing of tactile stimuli on the body (Exp. 1), and enhance the perception of near-threshold tactile stimuli (Exp. 2), only once they entered PPS. We then employed unconscious multisensory stimulation to manipulate BSC. Participants were presented with tactile stimulation on their body and with visual stimuli on a virtual body, seen at a distance, which were either visible or rendered invisible. We found that participants reported higher self-identification with the virtual body in the synchronous visuo-tactile stimulation (as compared to asynchronous stimulation; Exp. 3), and shifted their self-location toward the virtual body (Exp.4), even if stimuli were fully invisible. Our results indicate that multisensory inputs, even outside of awareness, are integrated and affect the phenomenological content of self-consciousness, grounding BSC firmly in the field of psychophysical consciousness studies.

In the so-called Full Body Illusion subjects watch a virtual body being stroked while they perceive tactile stimulation on their own body inducing illusory self-identification with the virtual body and a change in self-location towards the virtual body. In a related illusion, it has recently been shown that similar changes in self-identification and self-location can be observed when an interoceptive signal is used in association with visual stimulation of the virtual body (i.e., participants observe a virtual body illuminated in synchrony with their heartbeat). Although brain imaging and neuropsychological evidence suggest that the insular cortex is a core region for interoceptive processing (such as cardiac perception and awareness) as well as for self-consciousness, it is currently not known whether the insula mediates cardio-visual modulation of self-consciousness. Here we tested the involvement of insular cortex in heartbeat awareness and cardio-visual manipulation of bodily self-consciousness in a patient before and after resection of a selective right neoplastic insular lesion. Cardio-visual stimulation induced an abnormally enhanced state of bodily self-consciousness; in addition, cardio-visual manipulation was associated with an experienced loss of the spatial unity of the self (illusory bi-location and duplication of his body), not observed in healthy subjects. Heartbeat awareness was found to decrease after insular resection. Based on these data we propose that the insula mediates interoceptive awareness as well as cardio-visual effects on bodily self-consciousness and that insular processing of interoceptive signals is an important mechanism for the experienced unity of the self.

This phenomenon includes aspects such as the sense of owning a body (also known as body ownership) and has been suggested to arise from the integration of sensory signals from the body. Several studies have shown that temporally synchronous tactile stimulation of the real body and visual stimulation of a fake or virtual body can induce changes in bodily self-consciousness, typically resulting in a sense of illusory ownership over the fake body. The present study assessed the effect of anatomical congruency of visuo-tactile stimulation on bodily self-consciousness. A virtual body was presented and temporally synchronous visuo-tactile stroking was applied simultaneously to the participants' body and to the virtual body. We manipulated the anatomical locations of the visuo-tactile stroking (i.e., on the back, on the leg), resulting in congruent stroking (stroking was felt and seen on the back or the leg) or incongruent stroking (i.e., stroking was felt on the leg and seen on the back). We measured self-identification with the virtual body and self-location as well as skin temperature. Illusory self-identification with the avatar as well as changes in self-location were experienced in the congruent stroking conditions. Participants showed a decrease in skin temperature across several body locations during congruent stimulation.

In S. cerevisiae, more than 200 factors including ribosomal proteins and trans-acting factors are required for the ordered assembly of 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. To date, only few human homologs of these yeast ribosome synthesis factors have been characterized. Here, we used a systematic RNA interference (RNAi) approach to analyze the contribution of 464 candidate factors to ribosomal subunit biogenesis in human cells. The screen was based on visual readouts, using inducible, fluorescent ribosomal proteins as reporters. By performing computer-based image analysis utilizing supervised machine-learning techniques, we obtained evidence for a functional link of 153 human proteins to ribosome synthesis. Our data show that core features of ribosome assembly are conserved from yeast to human, but differences exist for instance with respect to 60S subunit export. Unexpectedly, our RNAi screen uncovered a requirement for the export receptor Exportin 5 (Exp5) in nuclear export of 60S subunits in human cells. We show that Exp5, like the known 60S exportin Crm1, binds to pre-60S particles in a RanGTP-dependent manner. Interference with either Exp5 or Crm1 function blocks 60S export in both human cells and frog oocytes, whereas 40S export is compromised only upon inhibition of Crm1. Thus, 60S subunit export is dependent on at least two RanGTP-binding exportins in vertebrate cells.', ""Structure of a human pre-40S particle points to a role for RACK1 in the final steps of 18S rRNA processing Synthesis of ribosomal subunits in eukaryotes is a complex and tightly regulated process that has been mostly characterized in yeast.

AD is characterized by toxic beta-amyloid (Ab) peptides produced by beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). beta-secretase inhibitors reduce A beta levels, but mechanism-based side effects arise because they also inhibit beta-cleavage of non-amyloid substrates like Neuregulin. We report that beta-secretase has a higher affinity for Neuregulin than it does for APP. Kinetic studies demonstrate that the affinities and catalytic efficiencies of beta-secretase are higher toward non-amyloid substrates than toward APP. We show that non-amyloid substrates are processed by beta-secretase in an endocytosis-independent manner.

Mutations in many familial AD-associated genes affect the production of the longer A beta 42 variant that preferentially accumulates in plaques. In the case of sporadic or late-onset AD, which accounts for greater than 95% of cases, several genes are implicated in increasing the risk, but whether they also cause the disease by altering amyloid levels is currently unknown. Through loss of function studies in a model cell line, here RNAi-mediated silencing of several late onset AD genes affected A beta levels is shown.

We present a detailed mechanistic model that furnishes a novel insight into the process of A beta 42 fibril formation and the molecular basis for the different structural transitions in the amyloid pathway. Our data reveal the structure and polymorphism of A beta fibrils to be critically influenced by the oligomeric state of the starting materials, the ratio of monomeric-to-aggregated forms of A beta 42 (oligomers and protofibrils), and the occurrence of secondary nucleation.

We used two data sources as exposure predictors: 1) a questionnaire on potentially exposure relevant characteristics and behaviors and 2) modeled RF-EMF from fixed site transmitters (mobile phone base stations, broadcast transmitters) at the participants' place of residence using a geospatial propagation model. Relevant exposure predictors, which were identified by means of multiple regression analysis, were the modeled RF-EMF at the participants' home from the propagation model, housing characteristics, ownership of communication devices (wireless LAN, mobile and cordless phones) and behavioral aspects such as amount of time spent in public transports. The proportion of variance explained (R-2) by the final model was 0.52.

56,176,56_predictors_predictive_biodiversity_predict,"[""Selecting from correlated climate variables: a major source of uncertainty for predicting species distributions under climate change Correlative species distribution models are frequently used to predict species' range shifts under climate change. However, climate variables often show high collinearity and most statistical approaches require the selection of one among strongly correlated variables. When causal relationships between species presence and climate parameters are unknown, variable selection is often arbitrary, or based on predictive performance under current conditions. While this should only marginally affect current range predictions, future distributions may vary considerably when climate parameters do not change in concert. We investigated this source of uncertainty using four highly correlated climate variables together with a constant set of landscape variables in order to predict current (2010) and future (2050) distributions of four mountain bird species in central Europe. Simulating different parameterization decisions, we generated a) four models including each of the climate variables singly, b) a model taking advantage of all variables simultaneously and c) an un-weighted average of the predictions of a). We compared model accuracy under current conditions, predicted distributions under four scenarios of climate change, and - for one species - evaluated back-projections using historical occurrence data. Although current and future variable-correlations remained constant, and the models' accuracy under contemporary conditions did not differ, future range predictions varied considerably in all climate change scenarios. Averaged models and models containing all climate variables simultaneously produced intermediate predictions; the latter, however, performed best in back-projections. This pattern, consistent across different modelling methods, indicates a benefit from including multiple climate predictors in ambiguous situations. Variable selection proved to be an important source of uncertainty for future range predictions, difficult to control using contemporary information. Small, but diverging changes of climate variables, masked by constant overall correlation patterns, can cause substantial differences between future range predictions which need to be accounted for, particularly when outcomes are intended for conservation decisions."", 'Prediction of plant species distributions across six millennia The usefulness of species distribution models (SDMs) in predicting impacts of climate change on biodiversity is difficult to assess because changes in species ranges may take decades or centuries to occur. One alternative way to evaluate the predictive ability of SDMs across time is to compare their predictions with data on past species distributions. We use data on plant distributions, fossil pollen and current and mid-Holocene climate to test the ability of SDMs to predict past climate-change impacts. We find that species showing little change in the estimated position of their realized niche, with resulting good model performance, tend to be dominant competitors for light. Different mechanisms appear to be responsible for among-species differences in model performance. Confidence in predictions of the impacts of climate change could be improved by selecting species with characteristics that suggest little change is expected in the relationships between species occurrence and climate patterns.', ""Accounting for niche truncation to improve spatial and temporal predictions of species distributions Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are essential tools for predicting climate change impact on species' distributions and are commonly employed as an informative tool on which to base management and conservation actions. Focusing only on a part of the entire distribution of a species for fitting SDMs is a common approach. Yet, geographically restricting their range can result in considering only a subset of the species' ecological niche (i.e., niche truncation) which could lead to biased spatial predictions of future climate change effects, particularly if future conditions belong to those parts of the species ecological niche that have been excluded for model fitting. The integration of large-scale distribution data encompassing the whole species range with more regional data can improve future predictions but comes along with challenges owing to the broader scale and/or lower quality usually associated with these data. Here, we compare future predictions obtained from a traditional SDM fitted on a regional dataset (Switzerland) to predictions obtained from data integration methods that combine regional and European datasets for several bird species breeding in Switzerland. Three models were fitted: a traditional SDM based only on regional data and thus not accounting for niche truncation, a data pooling model where the two datasets are merged without considering differences in extent or resolution, and a downscaling hierarchical approach that accounts for differences in extent and resolution. Results show that the traditional model leads to much larger predicted range changes (either positively or negatively) under climate change than both data integration methods. The traditional model also identified different variables as main drivers of species' distribution compared to data-integration models. Differences between models regarding predicted range changes were larger for species where future conditions were outside the range of conditions existing in the regional dataset (i.e., when future conditions implied extrapolation). In conclusion, we showed that (i) models calibrated on a geographically restricted dataset provide markedly different predictions than data integration models and (ii) that these differences are at least partly explained by niche truncation. This suggests that using data integration methods could lead to more accurate predictions and more nuanced range changes than regional SDMs through a better characterization of species' entire realized niches.""]","['predictors', 'predictive', 'biodiversity', 'predict', 'climate', 'prediction', 'predictions', 'predicting', 'predicted', 'climatic']",predictor,Predictive,Prediction,climate prediction,Climate Predictions,Climate Prediction,19

Induction of calreticulin increased the free Ca2+ concentration within the ER lumen, [Ca2+](ER), from 306 +/- 31 to 595 +/- 53 muM, and doubled the rate of ER refilling. [Ca2+](ER) remained elevated in the presence of thapsigargin, an inhibitor of SERCA-type Ca2+ ATPases. Under these conditions, store-operated Ca2+ influx appeared inhibited but could be reactivated by decreasing [Ca2+](ER) with the low affinity Ca2+ chelator N,N,N\',N\'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. In contrast, [Ca2+](ER) decreased much faster during stimulation with carbachol. The larger ER release was associated with a larger cytosolic Ca2+ response and, surprisingly, with a shorter mitochondrial Ca2+ response. The reduced mitochondrial signal was not associated with visible morphological alterations of mitochondria or with disruption of the contacts between mitochondria and the ER but correlated with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. Altered ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ responses were also observed in cells expressing an N-truncated calreticulin but not in cells overexpressing calnexin, a P-domain containing chaperone, indicating that the effects were mediated by the unique C-domain of calreticulin. In conclusion, calreticulin overexpression increases Ca2+ fluxes across the ER but decreases mitochondrial Ca2+ and membrane potential. The increased Ca2+ turnover between the two organelles might damage mitochondria, accounting for the increased susceptibility of cells expressing high levels of calreticulin to apoptotic stimuli.', 'Morphological and functional aspects of STIM1-dependent assembly and disassembly of store-operated calcium entry complexes The SOCE (store-operated Ca2+ entry) pathway is a central component of cell signalling that links the Ca2+ filling state of the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) to the activation of Ca2+-permeable channels at the PM (plasma membrane). SOCE channels maintain a high free Ca2+ concentration within the ER lumen required for the proper processing and folding of proteins, and fuel the long-term cellular Ca2+ signals that drive gene expression in immune cells. SOCE is initiated by the oligomerization on the membrane of the ER of STIMs (stromal interaction molecules) whose luminal EF-hand domain switches from globular to an extended conformation as soon as the free Ca2+ concentration within the ER lumen ([Ca2+](ER)) decreases below basal levels of similar to 500 mu M. The conformational changes induced by the unbinding of Ca2+ from the STIM1 luminal domain promote the formation of higher-order STIM1 oligomers that move towards the PM and exposes activating domains in STIM1 cytosolic tail that bind to Ca2+ channels of the Orai family at the PM and induce their activation. Both SOCE and STIM1 oligomerization are reversible events, but whether restoring normal [Ca2+](ER) levels is sufficient to initiate the deoligomerization of STIM1 and to control the termination of SOCE is not known. The translocation of STIM1 towards the PM involves the formation of specialized compartments derived from the ER that we have characterized at the ultrastructural level and termed the pre-cortical ER, the cortical ER and the thin cortical ER. Pre-cortical ER structures are thin ER tubules enriched in STIM1 extending along microtubules and located deep inside cells. The cortical ER is located in the cell periphery in very close proximity (8-11 nm) to the plasma membrane. The thin cortical ER consists of thinner sections of the cortical ER enriched in STIM1 and devoid of chaperones that appear to be specialized ER compartments dedicated to Ca2+ signalling.', 'Local Cytosolic Ca2+ Elevations Are Required for Stromal Interaction Molecule 1 (STIM1) De-oligomerization and Termination of Store-operated Ca2+ Entry The Ca2+ depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates the ubiquitous store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway that sustains long-term Ca2+ signals critical for cellular functions. ER Ca2+ depletion initiates the oligomerization of stromal interaction molecules (STIM) that control SOCE activation, but whether ER Ca2+ refilling controls STIM de-oligomerization and SOCE termination is not known. Here, we correlate the changes in free luminal ER Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+](ER)) and in STIM1 oligomerization, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between CFP-STIM1 and YFP-STIM1. We observed that STIM1 de-oligomerized at much lower [Ca2+](ER) levels during store refilling than it oligomerized during store depletion. We then refilled ER stores without adding exogenous Ca2+ using a membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator to provide a large reservoir of buffered Ca2+. This procedure rapidly restored pre-stimulatory [Ca2+](ER) levels but did not trigger STIM1 de-oligomerization, the FRET signals remaining elevated as long as the external [Ca2+] remained low. STIM1 dissociation evoked by Ca2+ readmission was prevented by SOC channel inhibition and was associated with cytosolic Ca2+ elevations restricted to STIM1 puncta, indicating that Ca2+ acts on a cytosolic target close to STIM1 clusters. These data indicate that the refilling of ER Ca2+ stores is not sufficient to induce STIM1 de-oligomerization and that localized Ca2+ elevations in the vicinity of assembled SOCE complexes are required for the termination of SOCE.']","['ca2', 'calcium', 'ligand', 'extracellular', 'calnexin', 'calreticulin', 'intracellular', 'membrane', 'proteins', 'cytosolic']",calnexin,Calcium,calcium,calnexin,Calcium Signaling,Calcium Signaling,19

Recent advances have shed light on the composition and structure of NPCs, but approaches that could map their organization in live cells are still lacking. Here, we introduce an in vivo method to perform nuclear radial intensity measurements (NuRIM) using fluorescence microscopy to determine the average position of NE-localized proteins along the nucleocytoplasmic transport axis. We apply NuRIM to study the organization of the NPC and the mobile transport machinery in budding yeast. This reveals a unique snapshot of the intact yeast NPC and identifies distinct steady-state localizations for various NE-associated proteins and nuclear transport factors. We find that the NPC architecture is robust against compositional changes and could also confirm that in contrast to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the scaffold Y complex is arranged symmetrically in the yeast NPC. Furthermore, NuRIM was applied to probe the orientation of intrinsically disordered FG-repeat segments, providing insight into their roles in selective NPC permeability and structure.', 'The direction of transport through the nuclear pore can be inverted Transport of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope is an active process that depends on soluble factors including the GTPase Ran. Ran-GTP is predominantly located in the nucleus and has been shown to regulate cargo binding and release of import and export receptors in their respective target compartments. Recently, it was shown that transport of receptor-cargo complexes across the nuclear pore complex (NPC) does not depend on GTP-hydrolysis by Ran; holt;ever, the mechanism of translocation is still poorly understood. Were, we show that the direction of transport through the NPC can be inverted in the presence of high concentrations of cytoplasmic Ran-GTP. Under these conditions, two different classes of export cargoes are transported into the nucleus in the absence of GTP hydrolysis. The inverted transport is very rapid and can be blocked by known inhibitors of nuclear protein export. These results suggest that the NPC functions as a facilitated transport channel, allowing the selective translocation of receptor-cargo complexes, We conclude that the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport is determined mainly by the compartmentalized distribution of Ran-GTP.', 'Dominant-negative mutants of importin-beta block multiple pathways of import and export through the nuclear pore complex Nuclear protein import proceeds through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), Importin-beta mediates translocation via direct interaction with NPC components and carries importin-alpha with the NLS substrate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, The import reaction is terminated by the direct binding of nuclear RanGTP to importin-beta which dissociates the importin heterodimer, Here, we analyse the sites of interaction on importin-beta for its multiple partners, Ran and importin-alpha respectively require residues 1-364 and 331-876 of importin-beta for binding, Thus, RanGTP-mediated release of importin-alpha from importin-beta is likely to be an active displacement rather than due to simple competition between Ran and importin-alpha for a common binding site, Importin-beta has at least two non-overlapping sites of interaction with the NPC, which could potentially be used sequentially during translocation, Our data also suggest that termination of import involves a transient release of importin-beta from the NPC, Importin-beta fragments which bind to the NPC, but not to Ran, resist this release mechanism, As would be predicted from this, these importin-beta mutants are very efficient inhibitors of NLS-dependent protein import, Surprisingly, however, they also inhibit M9 signal-mediated nuclear import as well as nuclear export of mRNA, U snRNA, and the NES-containing Rev protein, This suggests that mediators of these various transport events share binding sites on the NPC and/or that mechanisms exist to coordinate translocation through the NPC via different nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways.']","['nuclear', 'nucleocytoplasmic', 'molecular', 'nucleoporins', 'nucleoporin', 'nucleus', 'complexes', 'pore', 'proteins', 'transportin']",nucleoporin,Nucleocytoplasm,Nucleocytoplasmic,nucleoporin,Nuclear Transport,Nuclear Pore Complex,19
59,168,59_cancers_genomic_cancer_carcinoma,"['Specific Genomic Regions Are Differentially Affected by Copy Number Alterations across Distinct Cancer Types, in Aggregated Cytogenetic Data Background: Regional genomic copy number alterations (CNA) are observed in the vast majority of cancers. Besides specifically targeting well-known, canonical oncogenes, CNAs may also play more subtle roles in terms of modulating genetic potential and broad gene expression patterns of developing tumors. Any significant differences in the overall CNA patterns between different cancer types may thus point towards specific biological mechanisms acting in those cancers. In addition, differences among CNA profiles may prove valuable for cancer classifications beyond existing annotation systems. Principal Findings: We have analyzed molecular-cytogenetic data from 25579 tumors samples, which were classified into 160 cancer types according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system. When correcting for differences in the overall CNA frequencies between cancer types, related cancers were often found to cluster together according to similarities in their CNA profiles. Based on a randomization approach, distance measures from the cluster dendrograms were used to identify those specific genomic regions that contributed significantly to this signal. This approach identified 43 non-neutral genomic regions whose propensity for the occurrence of copy number alterations varied with the type of cancer at hand. Only a subset of these identified loci overlapped with previously implied, highly recurrent (hot-spot) cytogenetic imbalance regions. Conclusions: Thus, for many genomic regions, a simple null-hypothesis of independence between cancer type and relative copy number alteration frequency can be rejected. Since a subset of these regions display relatively low overall CNA frequencies, they may point towards second-tier genomic targets that are adaptively relevant but not necessarily essential for cancer development.', 'Predicting cancer type from tumour DNA signatures Results: We found the linear support vector machine to be the most predictive model of cancer type from gene alterations. Using only 100 somatic point-mutated genes for prediction, we achieved an overall accuracy of 49.4 +/- 0.4% (95% confidence interval). We observed a marked increase in the accuracy when copy number alterations are included as predictors. With a combination of somatic point mutations and copy number alterations, a mere 50 genes are enough to yield an overall accuracy of 77.7 +/- 0.3%. Methods: Using sequenced tumour DNA downloaded via the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics, we collected the presence or absence of calls for gene alterations for 6640 tumour samples spanning 28 cancer types, as predictive features. We employed three machine-learning techniques, namely linear support vector machines with recursive feature selection, L1-regularised logistic regression and random forest, to select a small subset of gene alterations that are most informative for cancer-type prediction. We then evaluated the predictive performance of the models in a comparative manner. Conclusions: A general cancer diagnostic tool that utilises either only somatic point mutations or only copy number alterations is not sufficient for distinguishing a broad range of cancer types. The combination of both gene alteration types can dramatically improve the performance. Background: Establishing the cancer type and site of origin is important in determining the most appropriate course of treatment for cancer patients. Patients with cancer of unknown primary, where the site of origin cannot be established from an examination of the metastatic cancer cells, typically have poor survival. Here, we evaluate the potential and limitations of utilising gene alteration data from tumour DNA to identify cancer types.', 'Genetic progression and the waiting time to cancer Cancer results from genetic alterations that disturb the normal cooperative behavior of cells. Recent high-throughput genomic studies of cancer cells have shown that the mutational landscape of cancer is complex and that individual cancers may evolve through mutations in as many as 20 different cancer-associated genes. We use data published by Sjoblom et al. ( 2006) to develop a new mathematical model for the somatic evolution of colorectal cancers. We employ the Wright-Fisher process for exploring the basic parameters of this evolutionary process and derive an analytical approximation for the expected waiting time to the cancer phenotype. Our results highlight the relative importance of selection over both the size of the cell population at risk and the mutation rate. The model predicts that the observed genetic diversity of cancer genomes can arise under a normal mutation rate if the average selective advantage per mutation is on the order of 1%. Increased mutation rates due to genetic instability would allow even smaller selective advantages during tumorigenesis. The complexity of cancer progression can be understood as the result of multiple sequential mutations, each of which has a relatively small but positive effect on net cell growth.']","['cancers', 'genomic', 'cancer', 'carcinoma', 'genome', 'carcinomas', 'genes', 'sequencing', 'tumors', 'gene']",cancer,Oncology,Oncology,cancer,Cancer Genomics,Cancer Genomics,19

Genetic mutants that fail to perform a group-beneficial function but that reap the benefits of belonging to the group should have a within-group selective advantage, provided that the mutants are not too common. Here we show that social cheating exists even among prokaryotes. The bacterium Myxococcus xanthus exhibits several social behaviours, including aggregation of cells into spore-producing fruiting bodies during starvation. We examined a number of M. xanthus genotypes that were defective for fruiting-body development, including several lines that evolved for 1,000 generations under asocial conditions(6) and others carrying defined mutations in developmental pathways(7-10), to determine whether they behaved as cheaters when mixed with their developmentally proficient progenitor. Clones from several evolved lines and two defined mutants exhibited cheating during development, being overrepresented among resulting spores relative to their initial frequency in the mixture. The ease of finding anti-social behaviours suggests that cheaters may be common in natural populations of M. xanthus.', 'Natural variation in developmental life-history traits of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus The soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus is a model for the study of cooperative microbial behaviours such as social motility and fruiting body formation. Several M. xanthus developmental traits that are frequently quantified for laboratory strains are likely to be significant components of fitness in natural populations, yet little is known about the degree to which such traits vary in the wild and may therefore be subject to natural selection. Here, we have tested whether several key M. xanthus developmental life-history traits have diverged significantly among strains both from globally distant origins and from within a sympatric, centimetre-scale population. The isolates examined here were found to vary considerably, in a heritable manner, in their rate of developmental aggregation and in both their rate and efficiency of spore production. Isolates also varied in the nutrient-concentration threshold triggering spore formation and in the heat resistance of spores. The large diversity of developmental phenotypes documented here leads to questions regarding the relative roles of selection and genetic drift in shaping the diversity of local soil populations with respect to these developmental traits. It also raises the question of whether fitness in the wild is largely determined by traits that are expressed independent of social context or by behaviours that are expressed only in genetically heterogeneous social groups.', 'Experimental social evolution with Myxococcus xanthus Genetically-based social behaviors are subject to evolutionary change in response to natural selection. Numerous microbial systems provide not only the opportunity to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying specific social interactions, but also to observe evolutionary changes in sociality over short time periods. Here we summarize experiments in which behaviors of the social bacterium Myxococcus xanthus changed extensively during evolutionary adaptation to two relatively asocial laboratory environments. M. xanthus moves cooperatively, exhibits cooperative multicellular development upon starvation and also appears to prey cooperatively on other bacteria. Replicate populations of M. xanthus were evolved in both structured (agar plate) and unstructured (liquid) environments that contained abundant resources. The importance of social cooperation for evolutionary fitness in these habitats was limited by the absence of positive selection for starvation-induced spore production or predatory efficiency. Evolved populations showed major losses in all measured categories of social proficiency- motility, predation, fruiting ability, and sporulation. Moreover, several evolved genotypes were observed to exploit the social behavior of their ancestral parent when mixed together during the developmental process. These experiments that resulted in both socially defective and socially exploitative genotypes demonstrate the power of laboratory selection experiments for studying social evolution at the microbial level. Results from additional selection experiments that place positive selection pressure on social phenotypes can be integrated with direct study of natural populations to increase our understanding of principles that underlie the evolution of microbial social behavior.']","['bacteria', 'bacterium', 'bacterial', 'microbes', 'microbial', 'evolutionary', 'myxococcus', 'species', 'evolution', 'populations']",myxococcus,Microbiology,Bacteria,myxococcus,Microbial Evolution,Bacterial Evolution,19

Ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) induces the plant photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) nuclear accumulation, where it regulates photomorphogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism for the UV-B-regulated UVR8 nuclear localization dynamics is unknown. With fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), cell fractionation followed by immunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays we tested the function of UVR8-interacting proteins including CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (RUP1) and RUP2 in the regulation of UVR8 nuclear dynamics in Arabidopsis thaliana. We showed that UV-B-induced rapid UVR8 nuclear translocation is independent of COP1, which previously was shown to be required for UV-B-induced UVR8 nuclear accumulation. Instead, we provide evidence that the UV-B-induced UVR8 homodimer-to-monomer photo-switch and the concurrent size reduction of UVR8 enables its monomer nuclear translocation, most likely via free diffusion. Nuclear COP1 interacts with UV-B-activated UVR8 monomer, thereby promoting UVR8 nuclear retention. Conversely, RUP1and RUP2, whose expressions are induced by UV-B, inhibit UVR8 nuclear retention via attenuating the UVR8-COP1 interaction, allowing UVR8 to exit the nucleus. Collectively, our data suggest that UV-B-induced monomerization of UVR8 promotes its nuclear translocation via free diffusion. In the nucleus, COP1 binding promotes UVR8 monomer nuclear retention, which is counterbalanced by the major negative regulators RUP1 and RUP2.', 'Cryptochrome-mediated blue-light signalling modulates UVR8 photoreceptor activity and contributes to UV-B tolerance in Arabidopsis UV-B constitutes a critical part of the sunlight reaching the earth surface. The homodimeric plant UV-B photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) monomerizes in response to UV-B and induces photomorphogenic responses, including UV-B acclimation and tolerance. REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS 1 (RUP1) and RUP2 are negative feedback regulators that operate by facilitating UVR8 ground state reversion through re-dimerization. Here we show that RUP1 and RUP2 are transcriptionally induced by cryptochrome photoreceptors in response to blue light, which is dependent on the bZIP transcriptional regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5). Elevated RUP1 and RUP2 levels under blue light enhance UVR8 re-dimerization, thereby negatively regulating UVR8 signalling and providing photoreceptor pathway cross-regulation in a polychromatic light environment, as is the case in nature. We further show that cryptochrome 1, as well as the red-light photoreceptor phytochrome B, contribute to UV-B tolerance redundantly with UVR8. Thus, photoreceptors for both visible light and UV-B regulate UV-B tolerance through an intricate interplay allowing the integration of diverse sunlight signals.', 'UVR8-mediated inhibition of shade avoidance involves HFR1 stabilization in Arabidopsis Sunlight provides the energy that powers photosynthesis and is thus of the utmost importance for plant growth and development. Plants grow in constantly changing environments, including highly variable light conditions. They have evolved specific light sensors (photoreceptors) that allow optimization of photosynthesis and survival, and adjusting growth and development to the prevailing environment. An intriguing example is the perception of competitors due to changes in the light transmitted and reflected by their leaves. As red light, but not far-red, is strongly absorbed by photosynthetic pigments, the red:far-red ratio (R:FR) is strongly reduced in the presence of competitors which is sensed by the phytochrome red/far-red photoreceptors. Detection of competitors results in stem elongation in shade-intolerant plants to overtop the neighbors and reach full sunlight (shade avoidance syndrome). UV-B sensed by the UVR8 photoreceptor inhibits shade avoidance by reducing the abundance and activity of specific transcriptional regulators PIF4 and PIF5. We have discovered an important role for an atypical transcriptional regulator HFR1 that is stabilized under UV-B, strongly contributing to the UVR8 photoreceptor-mediated repression of shade responses by counteracting PIF4 and PIF5 activities. This contributes significantly to a deeper mechanistic understanding of how plants integrate information from a complex light environment. Sun-loving plants perceive the proximity of potential light-competing neighboring plants as a reduction in the red:far-red ratio (R:FR), which elicits a suite of responses called the ""shade avoidance syndrome"" (SAS). Changes in R:FR are primarily perceived by phytochrome B (phyB), whereas UV-B perceived by UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) elicits opposing responses to provide a counterbalance to SAS, including reduced shade-induced hypocotyl and petiole elongation. Here we show at the genome-wide level that UVR8 broadly suppresses shade-induced gene expression. A subset of this gene regulation is dependent on the UVR8-stabilized atypical bHLH transcription regulator LONG HYPOCOTYL IN FAR-RED 1 (HFR1), which functions in part redundantly with PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 3-LIKE 1 (PIL1). In parallel, UVR8 signaling decreases protein levels of the key positive regulators of SAS, namely the bHLH transcription factors PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) and PIF5, in a COP1-dependent but HFR1-independent manner. We propose that UV-B antagonizes SAS via two mechanisms: degradation of PIF4 and PIF5, and HFR1- and PIL1-mediated inhibition of PIF4 and PIF5 function. This work highlights the importance of typical and atypical bHLH transcription regulators for the integration of light signals from different photoreceptors and provides further mechanistic insight into the crosstalk of UVR8 signaling and SAS.

Most binding sites even in promoters do not correlate with detectable rhythmic transcript levels. Luciferase fusions reveal that the circadian clock supports robust but low amplitude transcription rhythms of representative promoters. However, rhythmic transcription of these potentially clock-controlled genes is masked by non-circadian transcription that overwrites the weaker contribution of the clock in constant conditions. Our data suggest that U2OS cells harbor an intrinsically rather weak circadian oscillator. The oscillator has the potential to regulate a large number of genes. The contribution of circadian versus non-circadian transcription is dependent on the metabolic state of the cell and may determine the apparent complexity of the circadian transcriptome.', 'Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) Is a Post-Translational Regulator of the Mammalian Circadian Clock Circadian clocks coordinate the timing of important biological processes. Interconnected transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops based on a set of clock genes generate and maintain these rhythms with a period of about 24 hours. Many clock proteins undergo circadian cycles of post-translational modifications. Among these modifications, protein phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating activity, stability and intracellular localization of clock components. Several protein kinases were characterized as regulators of the circadian clock. However, the function of protein phosphatases, which balance phosphorylation events, in the mammalian clock mechanism is less well understood. Here, we identify protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) as regulator of period and light-induced resetting of the mammalian circadian clock. Down-regulation of PP1 activity in cells by RNA interference and in vivo by expression of a specific inhibitor in the brain of mice tended to lengthen circadian period. Moreover, reduction of PP1 activity in the brain altered light-mediated clock resetting behavior in mice, enhancing the phase shifts in either direction. At the molecular level, diminished PP1 activity increased nuclear accumulation of the clock component PER2 in neurons. Hence, PP1, may reduce PER2 phosphorylation thereby influencing nuclear localization of this protein. This may at least partially influence period and phase shifting properties of the mammalian circadian clock.', 'The Circadian Clock Coordinates Ribosome Biogenesis Biological rhythms play a fundamental role in the physiology and behavior of most living organisms. Rhythmic circadian expression of clock-controlled genes is orchestrated by a molecular clock that relies on interconnected negative feedback loops of transcription regulators. Here we show that the circadian clock exerts its function also through the regulation of mRNA translation. Namely, the circadian clock influences the temporal translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in ribosome biogenesis by controlling the transcription of translation initiation factors as well as the clock-dependent rhythmic activation of signaling pathways involved in their regulation. Moreover, the circadian oscillator directly regulates the transcription of ribosomal protein mRNAs and ribosomal RNAs. Thus the circadian clock exerts a major role in coordinating transcription and translation steps underlying ribosome biogenesis.']","['circadian', 'clocks', 'clock', 'rhythms', 'timing', 'time', 'synchronization', 'temporal', 'rhythm', 'physiology']",circadian rhythm,Chronobiology,Circadian,circadian rhythm,Circadian Rhythms,Circadian Rhythms,19

Here, we show that RNA interference-mediated downregulation of transcription is deleterious to endosperm development but does not block zygotic divisions. Furthermore, we show that RNA POLYMERASE II is less active in the embryo than in the endosperm. This dimorphic pattern is established late during female gametogenesis and is inherited by the two products of fertilization. This juxtaposition of distinct transcriptional activities correlates with differential patterns of histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation, LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 localization, and Histone H2B turnover in the egg cell versus the central cell. Thus, distinct epigenetic and transcriptional patterns in the embryo and endosperm are already established in their gametic progenitors. We further demonstrate that the non-CG DNA methyltransferase CHROMOMETHYLASE3 (CMT3) and DEMETER-LIKE DNA glycosylases are required for the correct distribution of H3K9 dimethylation in the egg and central cells, respectively, and that plants defective for CMT3 activity show abnormal embryo development. Our results provide evidence that cell-specific mechanisms lead to the differentiation of epigenetically distinct female gametes in Arabidopsis thaliana. They also suggest that the establishment of a quiescent state in the zygote may play a role in the reprogramming of the young plant embryo.', 'The female gametophyte and the endosperm control cell proliferation and differentiation of the seed coat in Arabidopsis Double fertilization of the female gametophyte produces the endosperm and the embryo enclosed in the maternal seed coat. Proper seed communication necessitates exchanges of signals between the zygotic and maternal components of the seed. However, the nature of these interactions remains largely unknown. We show that double fertilization of the Arabidopsis thaliana female gametophyte rapidly triggers sustained cell proliferation in the seed coat. Cell proliferation and differentiation of the seed coat occur in autonomous seeds produced in the absence of fertilization of the multicopy suppressor of ira1 (msi1) mutant. As msi1 autonomous seeds mostly contain autonomous endosperm, our results indicate that the developing endosperm is sufficient to enhance cell proliferation and differentiation in the seed coat. We analyze the effect of autonomous proliferation in the retinoblastoma-related1 (rbr1) female gametophyte on seed coat development. In contrast with msi1, supernumerary nuclei in rbr1 female gametophytes originate mainly from the endosperm precursor lineage but do not express an endosperm fate marker. In addition, defects of the rbr1 female gametophyte also reduce cell proliferation in the ovule integuments before fertilization and prevent further differentiation of the seed coat. Our data suggest that coordinated development of the seed components relies on interactions before fertilization between the female gametophyte and the surrounding maternal ovule integuments and after fertilization between the endosperm and the seed coat.', 'Arabidopsis MSI1 is a component of the MEA/FIE Polycomb group complex and required for seed development Seed development in angiosperms initiates after double fertilization, leading to the formation of a diploid embryo and a triploid endosperm.

Here we show that the Arabidopsis WD-40 domain protein MSI1 is present together with MEA and FIE in a 600 kDa complex and interacts directly with FIE. Mutant plants heterozygous for msi1 show a seed abortion ratio of 50% with seeds aborting when the mutant allele is maternally inherited, irrespective of a paternal wild-type or mutant MSI1 allele. Further more, msi1 mutant gametophytes initiate endosperm development in the absence of fertilization at a high penetrance. After pollination, only the egg cell becomes fertilized, the central cell starts dividing prior to fertilization, resulting in the formation of seeds containing embryos surrounded by diploid endosperm.

PPAR alpha mediates the effects of fibrates, which are potent hypolipidemic drugs, on gene expression. To better understand the biological effects of fibrates and PPAR alpha, we searched for genes regulated by PPAR alpha using oligonucleotide microarray and subtractive hybridization. By comparing liver RNA from wild-type and PPAR alpha null mice, it was found that PPAR alpha decreases the mRNA expression of enzymes involved in the metabolism of amino acids. Further analysis by Northern blot revealed that PPAR alpha influences the expression of several genes involved in trans- and deamination of amino acids, and urea synthesis. Direct activation of PPAR alpha using the synthetic PPAR alpha ligand WY14643 decreased mRNA levels of these genes, suggesting that PPAR alpha is directly implicated in the regulation of their expression. Consistent with these data, plasma urea concentrations are modulated by PPAR alpha in vivo. It is concluded that in addition to oxidation of fatty acids, PPAR alpha also regulates metabolism of amino acids in liver, indicating that PPAR alpha is a key controller of intermediary metabolism during fasting.', 'Multifaceted roles of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) at the cellular and whole organism levels Chronic disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, inflammation, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis, are related to alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism, in which peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)alpha, PPAR beta/delta and PPAR gamma are involved. These receptors form a subgroup of ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to the nuclear hormone receptor family. This review discusses a selection of novel PPAR functions identified during the last few years. The PPARs regulate processes that are essential for the maintenance of pregnancy and embryonic development. Newly found hepatic functions of PPAR alpha are the mediation of female-specific gene repression and the protection of the liver from oestrogen induced toxicity. PPAR alpha also controls lipid catabolism and is the target of hypolipidaemic drugs, whereas PPAR gamma controls adipocyte differentiation and regulates lipid storage; it is the target for the insulin sensitising thiazolidinediones used to treat type 2 diabetes. Activation of PPAR beta/delta increases lipid catabolism in skeletal muscle, the heart and adipose tissue. In addition, PPAR beta/delta ligands prevent weight gain and suppress macrophage derived inflammation. In fact, therapeutic benefits of PPAR ligands have been confirmed in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as encephalomyelitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, PPARs promote skin wound repair. PPAR alpha favours skin healing during the inflammatory phase that follows injury, whilst PPAR beta/delta enhances keratinocyte survival and migration. Due to their collective functions in skin, PPARs represent a major research target for our understanding of many skin diseases. Taken altogether, these functions suggest that PPARs serve as physiological sensors in different stress situations and remain valuable targets for innovative therapies.', 'Differential expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs): Tissue distribution of PPAR-alpha, -beta, and -gamma in the adult rat Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that can be activated by various xenobiotics and natural fatty acids. These transcription factors primarily regulate genes involved in lipid metabolism and also play a role in adipocyte differentiation. We present the expression patterns of the PPAR subtypes in the adult rat, determined by in situ hybridization using specific probes for PPAR-alpha, -beta and -gamma, and by immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the three rat PPAR subtypes. In numerous cell types from either ectodermal, mesodermal, or endodermal origin, PPARs are coexpressed, with relative levels varying between them from one cell type to the other.

To determine the effect of oxidative stress on liver regeneration and to identify the underlying signaling pathways, we studied liver repair in mice lacking the Nrf2 transcription factor. In these animals, expression of several cytoprotective enzymes was reduced in hepatocytes, resulting in oxidative stress. After partial hepatectomy, liver regeneration was significantly delayed. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, we identified oxidative stress-mediated insulin/insulin-like growth factor resistance as an underlying mechanism. This deficiency impaired the activation of p38 mitogenactivated kinase, Akt kinase and downstream targets after hepatectomy, resulting in enhanced death and delayed proliferation of hepatocytes. Our results reveal novel roles of Nrf2 in the regulation of growth factor signaling and in tissue repair. In addition, they provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress-induced defects in liver regeneration. These findings may provide the basis for the development of new strategies to improve regeneration in patients with acute or chronic liver damage.', 'Emerging functions of the nuclear receptor LRH-1 in liver physiology and pathology Nuclear receptors play pleiotropic roles in cell differentiation, development, proliferation, and metabolic processes to govern liver physiology and pathology. The nuclear receptor, liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2), originally identified in the liver as a regulator of bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis, was recently recognized to coordinate a multitude of other hepatic metabolic processes, including glucose and lipid processing, methyl group sensing, and cellular stress responses. In this review, we summarize the physiological and pathophysiological functions of LRH-1 in the liver, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes. This review also focuses on the recent advances highlighting LRH-1 as an attractive target for liverassociated diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).', 'Fibroblast growth factor receptor signalling is crucial for liver homeostasis and regeneration Several growth factors have been suggested to play a crucial role in liver regeneration, but a functional proof is still missing. Since fibroblast growth factors are important for the initiation of mammalian liver development, we determined the roles of these mitogens in liver repair by targeted expression of a dominant-negative fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) in hepatocytes of transgenic mice. The liver of young animals appeared histologically normal, and liver function was not obviously impaired. In aged transgenic mice, the frequency of fatty liver development was strongly increased compared to control animals. Following partial hepatectomy, transgenic mice showed markedly reduced hepatocyte proliferation because of an arrest in the late G(1) phase of the cell cycle.

Aim Four factors (time, dispersal, extinction and speciation) shape the differences in species richness within a clade between two regions. The southern African summer-rainfall Highveld' is less species rich than the adjacent winter-rainfall Greater Cape Floristic Region'. In many clades, this may be the result of a Cape origin of these temperate clades, with later dispersal to the cool uplands of the Highveld. We explored an alternative scenario of a widespread southern African Miocene temperate flora, which survived in the Cape. We used these four factors to seek the more likely scenario for the Danthonioideae. Main conclusions We found more support for the scenario of a southern African rather than a Cape origin of the danthonioids. The winter rainfall Cape became differentiated from the rest of southern Africa in the late Miocene. Late Miocene extinction, possibly driven by the expansion of C-4 grasses, may have decimated the Highveld lineages, whereas the Cape lineages continued to diversify. Exploring some other Cape clades may reveal more instances of the Cape acting as a museum' of southern African temperate diversity. Results We found no differences in the speciation rates between the two areas, and no clear indication of the ancestral area of the clade. However, one of the most likely BiSSE models found a lower extinction rate in the Cape, and another found a higher transition rate from summer rainfall to winter rainfall. Methods We used a rate-corrected and dated phylogeny including 118 of 134 species of African Danthonioideae (Poaceae), and assigned the species to be either winter rainfall (Cape) or summer rainfall (Highveld). We inferred speciation and extinction rates using TreePar and bamm for the whole clade and also for each rainfall regime, transition direction using BayesTraits and Lagrange, and integrated speciation-extinction-migration using BiSSE."", 'Phylogenetic relationships in Disa based on non-coding trnL-trnF chloroplast sequences: Evidence of numerous repeat regions Sequence data from the intron and spacer of the trnL-F chloroplast region elucidate the phylogenetic relationships, of the tribe Diseae (Orchidoideae: Orchidaceae). Within Diseae, 41 species of Disa, two of Brownleea, three of Satyrium. and two of Corycium were included, with five species of Habenaria sensu lato (Orchideae) and one epidendroid as outgroups.

The branching order of the five weakly supported the paraphyly of Diseae, with the successive divergence of Brownleea, Corycium, Habenaria, Satyrium, and Disa. Within the monophyletic Disa, three main groupings appeared, two strongly supported clades representing sect. Racemosae and sect. Coryphaea and the third grouping containing several clades currently grouped into sections based on morphological phylogenies. Some discrepancies between the molecular phylogeny and the phylogeny based on morphological characters may require reevaluation of some of the morphological characters.

67,153,67_parasite_prey_nestlings_parasites,"[""Induced responses of nestling great tits reduce hen flea reproduction The dynamics of host-parasite interactions depend to a large extent on the effect of host responses on parasite fitness. Exposure to parasites may induce behavioural or physiological responses in hosts that may reduce the subsequent survival or reproductive output of the parasite. Neonate hosts may further directly obtain immunologically active substances from their mother, for instance via milk in mammals or egg yolk in birds. However, the relative importance of maternally-derived and self-generated responses in inducing parasite resistance is poorly understood, especially in free-living vertebrates. Here we investigate the complementary effect of experimentally induced maternal and neonate responses in great tit (Parus major) hosts on the reproductive success of their common ectoparasite, the hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae). In the laboratory we measured the number of eggs and larvae produced by individual flea females collected from host nests. In addition, the total number of larvae produced by an experimentally set number of flea females in the host's nestbox was assessed under field conditions. There was no indication of maternally-transferred parasite resistance, since exposing the mother to fleas during the laying period did not affect the reproductive rate of fleas exploiting her offspring early or late in the nestling cycle. Independent of the maternal treatment, exposure of neonates to fleas early in the nestling period reduced the reproductive output of fleas late in the nestling cycle. The effect of the induced nestling response was seasonal, reducing flea reproduction in nests of early-breeding hosts but not in nests of late-breeding ones. Larvae production in the nestbox and in the laboratory was positively correlated, but under natural conditions the neonate response did not affect the size of the flea larvae population. Our results indicate induced responses as a means by which neonate avian hosts resist ectoparasites. Other factors, such as the environmental temperature and density-dependent larval competition, may be more important in determining the size of the future parasite populations."", ""A parasite-induced maternal effect can reduce survival times of fleas feeding on great tit nestlings Parents can increase their reproductive success by assisting their neonate offspring in parasite defence. In birds, parental tactics include post-hatching parental responses such as increased parental care and pre-hatching maternal effects such as the transfer of maternal antibodies via the egg. These parasite-induced parental responses are known to reduce the effects of parasites on offspring, but their costs for the parasite are largely unknown. In two separate experiments on great tits Parus major we assessed these costs for hen fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae. Half of the parents where exposed to fleas during egg-laying to induce the parental response, while control nests were left flea-free. In experiment 1 parents raised their own young and we measured the effect of combined pre- and post-hatching parental effects, while in experiment 2 a cross-foster design allowed us to assess the effects of pre-hatching maternal effects alone. In both experiments we let fleas take a blood meal on nestlings from either flea-exposed or unexposed parents. We then measured flea-feeding duration, the quantity of extracted blood, and the fleas' subsequent survival time. We found in both experiments that on the largest nestlings of a brood flea survival was significantly reduced by the parental effects, whereas on the smaller nestlings it was independent of parental effects. The pre- and post-hatching parental responses did neither affect duration nor size of a flea blood meal. These results suggest first that the pre-hatching maternal effects, i.e. the substances transferred to the nestling via the egg, have the potential to harm fleas without reducing flea feeding capacity, and second that the strength of the maternal response varies between the nestlings, either because maternal products are unequally distributed among eggs within a clutch, or because large nestlings can build up a response that enhances the effect of the maternal products."", ""Host condition and host immunity affect parasite fitness in a bird-ectoparasite system 2. In a 2 x 2 design, we manipulated both the access to food in great tit Parus major broods and the exposure of the nestlings to hen fleas Ceratophyllus gallinae, a common ectoparasite of hole-breeding birds. We subsequently investigated the role of manipulated host condition, host immunocompetence, and experimentally induced host defence in nestlings on the reproductive success of individual hen flea females. 5. Our study shows that the reproductive success of hen fleas is linked to the hosts' food supply early in life and their ability to mount induced immunological or physiological defence mechanisms. These interactions between host quality and parasite fitness are likely to influence host preference, host choice and parasite virulence and thus the evolutionary dynamics in host-parasite systems. 1. Parasites might preferentially feed on hosts in good nutritional condition as such hosts provide better resources for the parasites' own growth, survival and reproduction. However, hosts in prime condition are also better able to develop costly immunological or physiological defence mechanisms, which in turn reduce the parasites' reproductive success. The interplay between host condition, host defence and parasite fitness will thus play an important part in the dynamics of host-parasite systems. 3. The food supplementation of the nestlings significantly influenced the parasites' reproductive success. Female fleas laid significantly more eggs when feeding on food-supplemented hosts. 4. Previous parasite exposure of the birds affected the reproductive success of fleas. However, the impact of this induced host response on flea reproduction depended on the birds' natural level of immunocompetence, assessed by the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) skin test. Flea fecundity significantly decreased with increasing PHA response of the nestlings in previously parasite-exposed broods. No relationship between flea fitness and host immunocompetence was, however, found in previously unexposed broods. The PHA response thus correlates with the nestlings' ability to mount immunological or physiological defence mechanisms against hen fleas. No significant interaction effect between early flea exposure and food supplementation on the parasites' reproductive success was found.""]","['parasite', 'prey', 'nestlings', 'parasites', 'fleas', 'predation', 'birds', 'flea', 'breeding', 'bird']",flea,Parasitism,parasitism,flea,Bird Parasites,Avian Parasitism,19

More specifically, redundancy analyses showed that earthworm assemblages were best correlated with soil bulk density and with soil depth, the latter being positively correlated with soil age. Enchytraeid assemblages and the proportion of enchytraeid r-strategists were respectively best correlated with soil carbonate content and negatively correlated with soil age. Nematodes assemblages were best correlated with soil water content. Moreover, relationships between pairs of soil biota groups, and between each group and environmental (physical, chemical and functional) variables, varied along the soil age gradient (moving window analysis).

However, these three groups have rarely been studied together and only few studies exist for urban soils. We studied the diversity and community composition of annelids and nematodes in soils spanning more than two centuries of urban soil development in Neuchatel (Switzerland) and assessed the relationships 1) among these three groups and 2) between each group and environmental (physical, chemical and functional) characteristics of soils and soil age. This study provides new knowledge on urban soil biodiversity and how environmental conditions can influence soil diversity and community patterns in the urban context. The contrasted community patterns of earthworms, enchytraeids and nematodes in urban soils of different ages and their different ecological roles suggest that they represent potential complementary indicators of soil quality and functioning such as soil formation and organic matter dynamics.

A previous field experiment showed positive effects of plant diversity on diversity and activity of culturable soil bacteria. We examined soil carry-over effects of these experimental communities on subsequent plant growth and the development of soil microbial communities in pots. We inoculated sterile substrate with soil from the field experiment and then sowed three plant species - Dactylis glomerata, Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium pratense as monocultures or 3-species mixtures into the pots. We measured the phytometers over a period of 14 months. Thereafter, we sampled the soil in 3-species mixtures to analyze microbial communities. The original plant species richness and number of functional groups had positive soil carry-over effects on phytometer germination. Furthermore, in mixtures, species richness also stimulated short-term biomass production of phytometers and catabolic diversity of culturable soil bacteria. The number of plant functional groups had a positive effect on the amount of prokaryotic phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) but negative effects on the amount of eukaryotic PLFAs and the activity of culturable soil bacteria. The carry-over effects of plant diversity on phytometer growth disappeared with time. However, specific effects of the presence of particular functional groups or species in the original plant communities remained significant and were sometimes paralleled by effects on soil microbial communities. These results suggest that in the short term, soil carry-over effects of plant diversity are mediated by a general stimulation of soil microbes whereas the longer-term effects of particular plant species are more likely due to compositional shifts in soil microbial communities. Although the mechanisms of soil carry-over effects in biodiversity experiments remain to be determined, our study demonstrates that they exist and probably involve soil microbial communities.

Over time, associations between plant communities and their soil microbiota may strengthen and become more specific, resulting in stronger associations between plant and soil microbial diversity. We tested this hypothesis at the end of a 4-year field experiment in 48 plots with different plant species compositions established 13 years earlier in a biodiversity experiment in Jena, Germany. We factorially crossed plant community history (old vs. new plant communities) and soil legacy (old vs. new soil) with plant diversity (species richness levels 1, 2, 4 and 8, each with 12 different species compositions). We use the term 'plant community history' to refer to the co-occurrence history of plants in different species compositions in the Jena Experiment. We determined soil bacterial and fungal community composition in terms of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using 16S rRNA gene and ITS DNA sequencing. Plant community history (old plants) did not affect overall soil community composition but differentially affected bacterial richness and abundances of specific bacterial taxa in association with specific plant species compositions. Soil legacy (old soil) markedly increased soil bacterial richness and evenness and decreased fungal evenness. Soil fungal richness increased with plant species richness, regardless of plant community history or soil legacy, with the strongest difference between plant monocultures and mixtures. Specific plant species compositions and functional groups were associated with specific bacterial and fungal community compositions. Grasses increased fungal richness and evenness and legumes decreased fungal evenness, but bacterial diversity was not affected. Synthesis. Our findings indicate that as experimental ecosystems varying in plant diversity develop over time (2002-2010), plant species associate with specific soil microbial taxa. This can have long-lasting effects on below-ground community composition in re-assembled plant communities, as reflected in strong soil legacy signals still visible after 4 years (2011-2015).

69,149,69_genetic_chromosomes_chromosome_hybridogenetic,"['Evolutionary and developmental dynamics of sex-biased gene expression in common frogs with proto-Y chromosomes Conclusions: The proto-sex chromosome of common frogs does not show evidence of sexualization of gene expression, nor evidence for a faster rate of evolution. This challenges the notion that sexually antagonistic genes play a central role in the initial stages of sex-chromosome evolution. Background: The patterns of gene expression on highly differentiated sex chromosomes differ drastically from those on autosomes, due to sex-specific patterns of selection and inheritance. As a result, X chromosomes are often enriched in female-biased genes (feminization) and Z chromosomes in male-biased genes (masculinization). However, it is not known how quickly sexualization of gene expression and transcriptional degeneration evolve after sex-chromosome formation. Furthermore, little is known about how sex-biased gene expression varies throughout development. Results: We sample a population of common frogs (Rana temporaria) with limited sex-chromosome differentiation (proto-sex chromosome), leaky genetic sex determination evidenced by the occurrence of XX males, and delayed gonadal development, meaning that XY individuals may first develop ovaries before switching to testes. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we investigate the dynamics of gene expression throughout development, spanning from early embryo to froglet stages. Our results show that sex-biased expression affects different genes at different developmental stages and increases during development, reaching highest levels in XX female froglets. Additionally, sex-biased gene expression depends on phenotypic, rather than genotypic sex, with similar expression in XX and XY males; correlates with gene evolutionary rates; and is not localized to the proto-sex chromosome nor near the candidate sex-determining gene Dmrt1.', 'Ever-Young Sex Chromosomes in European Tree Frogs Non-recombining sex chromosomes are expected to undergo evolutionary decay, ending up genetically degenerated, as has happened in birds and mammals. Why are then sex chromosomes so often homomorphic in cold-blooded vertebrates? One possible explanation is a high rate of turnover events, replacing master sex-determining genes by new ones on other chromosomes. An alternative is that X-Y similarity is maintained by occasional recombination events, occurring in sex-reversed XY females. Based on mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, we estimated the divergence times between European tree frogs (Hyla arborea, H. intermedia, and H. molleri) to the upper Miocene, about 5.4-7.1 million years ago. Sibship analyses of microsatellite polymorphisms revealed that all three species have the same pair of sex chromosomes, with complete absence of X-Y recombination in males. Despite this, sequences of sex-linked loci show no divergence between the X and Y chromosomes. In the phylogeny, the X and Y alleles cluster according to species, not in groups of gametologs. We conclude that sex-chromosome homomorphy in these tree frogs does not result from a recent turnover but is maintained over evolutionary timescales by occasional X-Y recombination. Seemingly young sex chromosomes may thus carry old-established sex-determining genes, a result at odds with the view that sex chromosomes necessarily decay until they are replaced. This raises intriguing perspectives regarding the evolutionary dynamics of sexually antagonistic genes and the mechanisms that control X-Y recombination.', 'No evidence that Y-chromosome differentiation affects male fitness in a Swiss population of common frogs The canonical model of sex-chromosome evolution assigns a key role to sexually antagonistic (SA) genes on the arrest of recombination and ensuing degeneration of Y chromosomes. This assumption cannot be tested in organisms with highly differentiated sex chromosomes, such as mammals or birds, owing to the lack of polymorphism. Fixation of SA alleles, furthermore, might be the consequence rather than the cause of recombination arrest. Here we focus on a population of common frogs (Rana temporaria) where XY males with genetically differentiated Y chromosomes (nonrecombinant Y haplotypes) coexist with both XY degrees males with proto-Y chromosomes (only differentiated from X chromosomes in the immediate vicinity of the candidate sex-determining locus Dmrt1) and XX males with undifferentiated sex chromosomes (genetically identical to XX females). Our study finds no effect of sex-chromosome differentiation on male phenotype, mating success or fathering success. Our conclusions rejoin genomic studies that found no differences in gene expression between XY, XY degrees and XX males. Sexual dimorphism in common frogs might result more from the differential expression of autosomal genes than from sex-linked SA genes. Among-male variance in sex-chromosome differentiation seems better explained by a polymorphism in the penetrance of alleles at the sex locus, resulting in variable levels of sex reversal (and thus of X-Y recombination in XY females), independent of sex-linked SA genes.']","['genetic', 'chromosomes', 'chromosome', 'hybridogenetic', 'evolutionary', 'recombination', 'genes', 'genome', 'evolution', 'mating']",gene,Genetics,genetics,gene,Genetic Evolution,Genetic Evolution,19

Several studies have shown increased axonal regeneration and enhanced compensatory sprouting, along with substantially improved functional recovery after treatment with anti-Nogo-A antibodies, Nogo-receptor antagonists, or inhibition of the downstream mediator RhoA/ROCK in adult rodents. Proof-of-concept studies in spinal cord-injured macaque monkeys with anti-Nogo-A antibodies have replicated these findings; recently, clinical trials in spinal cord-injured patients have begun. However, the optimal time window for successful Nogo-A function blocking treatments has not yet been determined.

Nogo-A knockout (KO) mice were viable, fertile, and not obviously afflicted by major developmental or neurological disturbances. The shorter splice form Nogo-B was strongly upregulated in the CNS. The inhibitory effect of spinal cord extract for growing neurites was decreased in the KO mice. Two weeks following adult dorsal hemisection of the thoracic spinal cord, Nogo-A KO mice displayed more corticospinal tract (CST) fibers growing toward and into the lesion compared to their wild-type littermates. CST fibers caudal to the lesion-regenerating and/or sprouting from spared intact fibers-were also found to be more frequent in Nogo-A-deficient animals.', 'Patterns of Nogo mRNA and protein expression in the developing and adult rat and after CNS lesions Nogo-A is a neurite growth inhibitor involved in regenerative failure and restriction of structural plasticity in the adult CNS. Three major protein products (Nogo-A, -B, and -C) are derived from the nogo gene. Here we describe the embryonic and postnatal expression of the three Nogo isoforms in the rat by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Northern and Western blot analysis indicated that Nogo-A is predominantly expressed in the nervous system with lower levels also present in testis and heart. In CNS myelin, confocal and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that Nogo-A is expressed in oligodendrocyte cell bodies and processes and localized in the innermost adaxonal and outermost myelin membranes. Additionally, we find Nogo-A to be expressed by projection neurons, in particular during development, and by postmitotic cells in the developing cortex, spinal cord, and cerebellum. The expression levels of Nogo-A/B were not changed significantly after traumatic lesions to the cortex or spinal cord. Nogo-B showed widespread expression in the central and peripheral nervous systems and other peripheral tissues. Nogo-C was mainly found in skeletal muscle, but brain and heart were also found to express this isoform. The localization of Nogo-A in oligodendrocytes fits well with its role as a myelin-associated inhibitor of regenerative fiber growth and structural plasticity. However, expression of Nogo-A in other tissues and, in particular, in neurons and the widespread expression of the two shorter isoforms, Nogo-B and -C, suggest that the Nogo family of proteins might have function(s) additional to the neurite growth-inhibitory activity.']","['neuronal', 'neurons', 'mice', 'axons', 'myelin', 'myelinated', 'inhibitory', 'rats', 'synaptic', 'neurite']",biology,Neurobiology,Neuroscience,biology,Neuronal Development,Neuronal Function,19

Although genetic variation within AMF species has been given less attention, it could potentially be an ecologically important source of variation. Ongoing studies on variability in AMF genes within Glomus intraradices indicate that at least for some genes, such as the BiP gene, sequence variability can be high, even in coding regions. This suggests that genetic variation within an AMF may not be selectively neutral. This clearly needs to be investigated in more detail for other coding regions of AMF genomes. Similarly, studies on AMF population genetics indicate high genetic variation in AMF populations, and a considerable amount of variation seen in phenotypes in the population can be attributed to genetic differences among the fungi. The existence of high within-species genetic variation could have important consequences for how investigations on AMF gene expression and function are conducted. Furthermore, studies of within-species genetic variability and how it affects variation in plant growth will help to identify at what level of precision ecological studies should be conducted to identify AMF in plant roots in the field. A population genetic approach to studying AMF genetic variability can also be useful for inoculum development. By knowing the amount of genetic variability in an AMF population, the maximum and minimum numbers of spores that will contain a given amount of genetic diversity can be estimated. This could be particularly useful for developing inoculum with high adaptability to different environments.', 'Genetic variability in a population of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi causes variation in plant growth Different species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) alter plant growth and affect plant coexistence and diversity. Effects of within-AMF species or within-population variation on plant growth have received less attention. High genetic variation exists within AMF populations. However, it is unknown whether genetic variation contributes to differences in plant growth. In our study, a population of AMF was cultivated under identical conditions for several generations prior to the experiments thus avoiding environmental maternal effects. We show that genetically different Glomus intraradices isolates from one AMF population significantly alter plant growth in an axenic system and in greenhouse experiments. Isolates increased or reduced plant growth meaning that plants potentially receive benefits or are subject to costs by forming associations with different individuals in the AMF population. This shows that genetic variability in AMF populations could affect host-plant fitness and should be considered in future research to understand these important soil organisms.', 'Changes in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal phenotypes and genotypes in response to plant species identity and phosphorus concentration We found significant genotype-by-environment interactions for AMF fitness traits in response to these treatments. Host identity had a strong effect on the fitness of different AMF, unearthing a specificity of response within Glomus intraradices. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi individuals grown in novel environments consistently showed a reduced presence of polymorphic genetic markers, providing some evidence for host or phosphate-induced genetic change in AMF. Given that AMF individuals can form extensive hyphal networks colonizing different hosts simultaneously, contrasting habitats or soil properties may lead to evolution in the population. Local selection may alter the structure of AMF populations and maintain genetic diversity, potentially even within the hyphal network of one fungus. Here, we measured genetic changes and changes in fitness-related traits of genetically distinct AMF individuals from one field, grown with different concentrations of available phosphate or different host species. P>Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are plant symbionts that improve floristic diversity and ecosystem productivity. Many AMF species are generalists with wide host ranges. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi individuals are heterokaryotic, and AMF populations are genetically diverse.

72,145,72_phenotypic_traits_trait_owls,"['Similar patterns of local barn owl adaptation in the Middle East and Europe with respect to melanic coloration The maintenance of phenotypic variation is a central question in evolutionary biology. A commonly suggested mechanism is that of local adaptation, whereby different phenotypes are adapted to alternative environmental conditions. A recent study in the European barn owl (Tyto alba) has shown that natural selection maintains a strong clinal variation in reddish pheomelanin-based coloration. Studies in the region where phenotypic variation in this owl is the highest in Europe have further demonstrated that dark-reddish and pale-reddish owls exploit open and wooded habitats, predate voles and wood mice, and are long-tailed and short-tailed, respectively. However, it remains unclear as to whether these traits evolved as a consequence of allopatric evolution of dark colour in northern Europe and white colour in southern Europe, during which owls could have also evolved different morphologies and foraging behaviour. This scenario implies that covariation between coloration and foraging behaviour could be a specificity of the European continent, which is not found in other worldwide-distributed populations. To investigate this issue, we studied a barn owl population in the Middle East. The results obtained show that, as in Central Europe, dark-reddish female owls breed more often in the open landscape than their pale-reddish female conspecifics, their offspring are fed with more voles than Muridae, and they are longer-winged and longer-tailed. These findings indicate that, in the barn owl, the association in females between pheomelanin-based coloration and foraging behaviour and morphology is not restricted to the European continent but may well evolve in sympatry in many barn owl populations worldwide. (c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 106, 447454.', 'Why do melanin ornaments signal individual quality? Insights from metal element analysis of barn owl feathers Melanin-based variation in colour patterns is under strong genetic control and not, or weakly, sensitive to the environment and body condition. Current signalling theory predicts that such traits may not signal honestly phenotypic quality because their production does not entail a significant fitness cost. However, recent studies revealed that in several bird species melanin-based traits covary with phenotypic attributes. In a first move to understand whether such covariations have a physiological basis, we quantified concentrations of five chemical elements in two pigmented plumage traits in the barn owl (Tyto alba). This bird shows continuous variation from immaculate to heavily marked with black spots (plumage spottiness) and from dark reddish-brown to white (plumage coloration), two traits that signal various aspects of individual quality. These two traits are sexually dimorphic with females being spottier and darker coloured than males. We found an enhancement in calcium and zinc concentration within black spots compared with the unspotted feather parts. The degree to which birds were spotted was positively correlated with calcium concentration within spots, whereas the unspotted feather parts of darker reddish-brown birds were more concentrated in zinc. This suggests that two different pigments are responsible for plumage spottiness and plumage coloration. We discuss the implications of our results in light of recent experimental field studies showing that female spottiness signals offspring humoral response towards an artificially administrated antigen, parasite resistance and fluctuating asymmetry of wing feathers.', 'Evolutionary trade-off between naturally- and sexually-selected melanin-based colour traits in worldwide barn owls and allies Natural selection typically constrains the evolution of sexually-selected characters. The evolution of naturally- and sexually-selected traits can be intertwined if they share part of their genetic machinery or if sex traits impair foraging success or increase the risk of depredation. The present study investigated phenotypic correlations between naturally- and sexually-selected plumage traits in the Tytonidae (barn owls, grass owls, and masked owls). Phenotypic correlations indicate the extent to which selection on one trait will indirectly influence the evolution of another trait. In this group of birds, the ventral body side varies from white to dark reddish, a naturally- selected pheomelanin-based colour trait with important roles in predator-prey interactions. Owls also exhibit eumelanin-based black spots, for which number and size signal different aspects of individual quality and are used in mate choice. These three plumage traits are strongly heritable and sexually dimorphic, with females being on average darker reddish and more spotted than males. Phenotypic correlations were measured between these three plumage traits in 3958 free-living barn owls in Switzerland and 10 670 skin specimens from 34 Tyto taxa preserved in museums. Across Tyto taxa, the sexually-selected plumage spottiness was positively correlated with the naturally- selected reddish coloration, with redder birds being more heavily spotted. This suggests that they are genetically constrained or that natural and sexual selection are not antagonistically exerted on plumage traits. In a large sample of Swiss nestlings and within 34 Tyto taxa, the three plumage traits were positively correlated. The production of melanin pigments for one plumage trait is therefore not traded off against the production of melanin pigments for another plumage trait. Only in the most heavily-spotted Tyto taxa do larger-spotted individuals display fewer spots. This indicates that, at some threshold value, the evolution of many spots constrains the evolution of large spots. These analyses raise the possibility that different combinations of melanin-based plumage traits may not be selectively equivalent.

During development, their functional domains are colinear with their genomic positions within the HoxD cluster such that Hoxd13 and Hoxd12 are necessary for digit development, whereas Hoxd11 and Hoxd10 are involved in making forearms. Mutational analyses of these genes have demonstrated their importance and illustrated the requirement for a precise control of their expression during early limb morphogenesis. To study the nature of this control, we have scanned the posterior part of the HoxD complex with a targeted reporter transgene and analyzed the response of this foreign promoter to limb regulatory influences. The results suggest that this regulation is achieved through the opposite effects of two enhancer elements which would compete with each other for interacting with nearby-located promoters. The physical position of a given gene within this genomic interval of opposite regulations might thus determine its final expression pattern. This model provides a conceptual link between the morphology of the future limb and the genetic organization of the Hox gene cluster, a translation of a genomic context into a morphogenetic topology.

Hoxd-11, for instance, is necessary in combination with other Hox genes for the proper development of different parts of the tetrapod limbs. Sequence comparisons between the mouse, chicken, and zebrafish Hoxd-11 loci have revealed the conservation of several blocks of DNA sequence which may be of importance for the regulation of Hoxd-11 expression. We have Used transgenic mice to show that one of these conserved elements specifically drives expression in a proximal-posterior part of developing forelimbs. Production of mice transgenic for a full fish Hoxd-11 construct as well as for mousefish Hoxd-11 chimeric constructs shows that the fish counterpart of this sequence is able to elicit expression in mouse forelimbs as well, though in a slightly different domain. However, this fish element requires the presence of the mouse promoter and does not work in its own context.

We analyzed single-limb bud cell transcriptomes and show that Hox genes are expressed in specific combinations that appear to match particular cell types. In cells giving rise to digits, we find that the expression of the five relevant Hoxd genes (Hoxd9 to Hoxd13) is unbalanced, despite their control by known global enhancers. We also report that specific combinatorial expression follows a pseudo-time sequence, which is established based on the transcriptional diversity of limb progenitors. Background: Global analyses of gene expression during development reveal specific transcription patterns associated with the emergence of various cell types, tissues, and organs. These heterogeneous patterns are instrumental to ensure the proper formation of the different parts of our body, as shown by the phenotypic effects generated by functional genetic approaches. However, variations at the cellular level can be observed within each structure or organ. In the developing mammalian limbs, expression of Hox genes from the HoxD cluster is differentially controlled in space and time, in cells that will pattern the digits and the forearms. While the Hoxd genes broadly share a common regulatory landscape and large-scale analyses have suggested a homogenous Hox gene transcriptional program, it has not previously been clear whether Hoxd genes are expressed together at the same levels in the same cells. Conclusions: Our observations reveal the existence of distinct combinations of Hoxd genes at the single-cell level during limb development. In addition, we document that the increasing combinatorial expression of Hoxd genes in this developing structure is associated with specific transcriptional signatures and that these signatures illustrate a temporal progression in the differentiation of these cells.']","['hoxd13', 'genes', 'gene', 'genomic', 'transgenic', 'vertebrate', 'hoxd', 'morphogenesis', 'hox', 'mice']",hoxd13,Hox,Hox,hoxd13,Hox Genes,Hox Genes in Vertebrate Development,19

The Arabidopsis regulatory leucine-rich repeat RLK (LRR-RLK) BAK1 is involved in steroid hormone responses, innate immunity, and cell death control. Here, we describe the differential regulation of three different BAK1-dependent signaling pathways by a novel allele of BAK1, bak1-5. Innate immune signaling mediated by the BAK1-dependent RKs FLS2 and EFR is severely compromised in bak1-5 mutant plants. However, bak1-5 mutants are not impaired in BR signaling or cell death control. We also show that, in contrast to the RD kinase BRI1, the non-RD kinases FLS2 and EFR have very low kinase activity, and we show that neither was able to trans-phosphorylate BAK1 in vitro. Furthermore, kinase activity for all partners is completely dispensable for the ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS2 or EFR with BAK1 in planta, revealing another pathway specific mechanistic difference. The specific suppression of FLS2- and EFR-dependent signaling in bak1-5 is not due to a differential interaction of BAK1-5 with the respective ligand-binding RK but requires BAK1-5 kinase activity. Overall our results demonstrate a phosphorylation-dependent differential control of plant growth, innate immunity, and cell death by the regulatory RLK BAK1, which may reveal key differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ligand-binding RD and non-RD RKs.', 'The Arabidopsis Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinases BAK1/SERK3 and BKK1/SERK4 Are Required for Innate Immunity to Hemibiotrophic and Biotrophic Pathogens Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) constitutes an important layer of innate immunity in plants. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinases EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and FLAGELLIN SENSING2 (FLS2) are the PRRs for the peptide PAMPs elf18 and flg22, which are derived from bacterial EF-Tu and flagellin, respectively. Using coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses, we demonstrated that EFR and FLS2 undergo ligand-induced heteromerization in planta with several LRR receptor-like kinases that belong to the SOMATIC-EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) family, including BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ASSOCIATED KINASE1/SERK3 (BAK1/SERK3) and BAK1-LIKE1/SERK4 (BKK1/SERK4). Using a novel bak1 allele that does not exhibit pleiotropic defects in brassinosteroid and cell death responses, we determined that BAK1 and BKK1 cooperate genetically to achieve full signaling capability in response to elf18 and flg22 and to the damage-associated molecular pattern AtPep1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BAK1 and BKK1 contribute to disease resistance against the hemibiotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae and the obligate biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Our work reveals that the establishment of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) relies on the rapid ligand-induced recruitment of multiple SERKs within PRR complexes and provides insight into the early PTI signaling events underlying this important layer of plant innate immunity.', 'Brassinosteroids inhibit pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune signaling independent of the receptor kinase BAK1 Plants and animals use innate immunity as a first defense against pathogens, a costly yet necessary tradeoff between growth and immunity. In Arabidopsis, the regulatory leucine-rich repeat receptor- like kinase (LRR-RLK) BAK1 combines with the LRR-RLKs FLS2 and EFR in pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and the LRR-RLK BRI1 in brassinosteroid (BR)mediated growth. Therefore, a potential tradeoff between these pathways mediated by BAK1 is often postulated. Here, we show a unidirectional inhibition of FLS2-mediated immune signaling by BR perception. Unexpectedly, this effect occurred downstream or independently of complex formation with BAK1 and associated downstream phosphorylation. Thus, BAK1 is not rate-limiting in these pathways. BRs also inhibited signaling triggered by the BAK1-independent recognition of the fungal PAMP chitin. Our results suggest a general mechanism operative in plants in which BR-mediated growth directly antagonizes innate immune signaling.']","['kinases', 'plants', 'signaling', 'immune', 'plant', 'pathogen', 'kinase', 'receptors', 'receptor', 'arabidopsis']",arabidopsis,Phytokinase,signaling,arabidopsis,Plant Immune Signaling,Plant Immune Signaling,19

Recent work shows that the fitness effect of a given resistance mutation is influenced by other resistance mutations on the same genome. However, resistant bacteria acquire additional beneficial mutations during evolution in the absence of antibiotics that do not alter resistance directly but may modify the fitness effects of new resistance mutations. Conclusions: Epistatic variation of costs of resistance can result from evolution in the absence of antibiotics, as well as the presence of other resistance mutations. Results: We experimentally evolved rifampicin-resistant and sensitive Escherichia coli in a drug-free environment, before measuring the effects of new resistance elements on fitness in antibiotic-free conditions. Streptomycin-resistance mutations had small fitness effects in rifampicin-resistant genotypes that had adapted to antibiotic-free growth medium, compared to the same genotypes without adaptation. We observed a similar effect when resistance was encoded by a different mechanism and carried on a plasmid. Antibiotic-sensitive bacteria that adapted to the same conditions showed the same pattern for some resistance elements but not others.', 'Associations among Antibiotic and Phage Resistance Phenotypes in Natural and Clinical Escherichia coli Isolates IMPORTANCE Rising antibiotic resistance is making it harder to treat bacterial infections. Whether resistance to a given antibiotic spreads or declines is influenced by whether it is associated with altered susceptibility to other antibiotics or other stressors that bacteria encounter in nature, such as bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). We used natural and clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, an abundant species and key pathogen, to characterize associations among resistance phenotypes to various antibiotics and bacteriophages. We found associations between some resistance phenotypes, and in contrast to past work with laboratory strains, they were exclusively positive. Analysis of bacterial genome sequences and horizontally transferred genetic elements (plasmids) helped to explain this, as well as our finding that there was no overall association between antibiotic resistance and bacteriophage resistance profiles across isolates. This improves our understanding of resistance evolution in nature, potentially informing new rational therapies that combine different antibacterials, including bacteriophages. The spread of antibiotic resistance is driving interest in new approaches to control bacterial pathogens. This includes applying multiple antibiotics strategically, using bacteriophages against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and combining both types of antibacterial agents. All these approaches rely on or are impacted by associations among resistance phenotypes (where bacteria resistant to one antibacterial agent are also relatively susceptible or resistant to others). Experiments with laboratory strains have shown strong associations between some resistance phenotypes, but we lack a quantitative understanding of associations among antibiotic and phage resistance phenotypes in natural and clinical populations. To address this, we measured resistance to various antibiotics and bacteriophages for 94 natural and clinical Escherichia coli isolates. We found several positive associations between resistance phenotypes across isolates. Associations were on average stronger for antibacterial agents of the same type (antibiotic-antibiotic or phage-phage) than different types (antibiotic-phage). Plasmid profiles and genetic knockouts suggested that such associations can result from both colocalization of resistance genes and pleiotropic effects of individual resistance mechanisms, including one case of antibiotic-phage cross-resistance. Antibiotic resistance was predicted by core genome phylogeny and plasmid profile, but phage resistance was predicted only by core genome phylogeny. Finally, we used observed associations to predict genes involved in a previously uncharacterized phage resistance mechanism, which we verified using experimental evolution. Our data suggest that susceptibility to phages and antibiotics are evolving largely independently, and unlike in experiments with lab strains, negative associations between antibiotic resistance phenotypes in nature are rare. This is relevant for treatment scenarios where bacteria encounter multiple antibacterial agents.', 'Resistance Gene Carriage Predicts Growth of Natural and Clinical Escherichia coli Isolates in the Absence of Antibiotics Bacterial pathogens that carry antibiotic resistance alleles sometimes pay a cost in the form of impaired growth in antibiotic-free conditions. This cost of resistance is expected to be a key parameter for understanding how resistance spreads and persists in pathogen populations. Analysis of individual resistance alleles from laboratory evolution and natural isolates has shown they are typically costly, but these costs are highly variable and influenced by genetic variation at other loci. It therefore remains unclear how strongly resistance is linked to impaired antibiotic-free growth in bacteria from natural and clinical scenarios, where resistance alleles are likely to coincide with other types of genetic variation. To investigate this, we measured the growth of 92 natural and clinical Escherichia coil isolates across three antibiotic-free environments. We then tested whether variation of antibiotic-free growth among isolates was predicted by their resistance to 10 antibiotics, while accounting for the phylogenetic structure of the data. We found that isolates with similar resistance profiles had similar antibiotic-free growth profiles, but it was not simply that higher average resistance was associated with impaired growth. Next, we used whole-genome sequences to identify antibiotic resistance genes and found that isolates carrying a greater number of resistance gene types grew relatively poorly in antibiotic-free conditions, even when the resistance genes they carried were different. This suggests that the resistance of bacterial pathogens is linked to growth costs in nature, but it is the total genetic burden and multivariate resistance phenotype that predict these costs, rather than individual alleles or mean resistance across antibiotics. IMPORTANCE Managing the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is a major challenge for global public health. Central to this challenge is understanding whether resistance is linked to impaired bacterial growth in the absence of antibiotics, because this determines whether resistance declines when bacteria are no longer exposed to antibiotics. We studied 92 isolates of the key bacterial pathogen Escherichia colt these isolates varied in both their antibiotic resistance genes and other parts of the genome. Taking this approach, rather than focusing on individual genetic changes associated with resistance as in much previous work, revealed that growth without antibiotics was linked to the number of specialized resistance genes carried and the combination of antibiotics to which isolates were resistant but was not linked to average antibiotic resistance. This approach provides new insights into the genetic factors driving the long-term persistence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which is important for future efforts to predict and manage resistance.']","['antibiotic', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial', 'coli', 'bacteria', 'antibiotics', 'resistant', 'pathogens', 'resistance', 'pathogen']",antibiotics,Antimicrobials,Antibiotics,antibiotics,Antibiotic Resistance,Antibiotic Resistance,19

A nonlinear relationship between the specific riboflavin production rate and the dilution rate was observed, revealing a coupling of product formation and growth under strict substrate-limited conditions, Most prominently, riboflavin formation completely ceased at specific growth rates below 0.15 h(-1). For molecular characterization of B. subtilis, the total amino acid composition of the wild type was experimentally determined and the complete building block requirements for biomass formation were derived, In particular, the murein sacculus was found to constitute approximately 9% of B. subtilis biomass, three to fivefold more than in Escherichia coli, Estimation of intracellular metabolic fluxes by a refined mass balance approach revealed a substantial, growth rate-dependent flux through the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, Furthermore, this Bur is indicated to be increased in the strain engineered for riboflavin formation, Glucose catabolism at low growth rates with reduced biomass yields was supported mainly by the tricarboxylic acid cycle.', 'Bacillus subtilis metabolism and energetics in carbon-limited and excess-carbon chemostat culture The energetic efficiency of microbial growth is significantly reduced in cultures growing under glucose excess compared to cultures growing under glucose limitation, but the magnitude to which different energy-dissipating processes contribute to the reduced efficiency is currently not well understood. We introduce here a new concept for balancing the total cellular energy flux that is based on the conversion of energy and carbon fluxes into energy equivalents, and we apply this concept to glucose-, ammonia-, and phosphate-limited chemostat cultures of riboflavin-producing Bacillus subtilis. Based on [U-C-13(6)] glucose-labeling experiments and metabolic flux analysis, the total energy flux in slow-growing, glucose-limited B. subtilis is almost exclusively partitioned in maintenance metabolism and biomass formation. In excess-glucose cultures, in contrast, uncoupling of anabolism and catabolism is primarily achieved by overflow metabolism, while two quantified futile enzyme cycles and metabolic shifts to energetically less efficient pathways are negligible. In most cultures, about 20% of the total energy flux could not be assigned to a particular energy-consuming process and thus are probably dissipated by processes such as ion leakage that are not being considered at present. In contrast to glucose- or ammonia-limited cultures, metabolic flux analysis revealed low tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle fluxes in phosphate-limited B. subtilis, which is consistent with CcpA-dependent catabolite repression of the cycle and/or transcriptional activation of genes involved in overflow metabolism in the presence of excess glucose. ATP-dependent control of in vivo enzyme activity appears to be irrelevant for the observed differences in TCA cycle fluxes.', 'Metabolic fluxes in riboflavin-producing Bacillus subtilis The pentose phosphate pathway and the pyruvate shunt were identified as major pathways of glucose catabolism in a recombinant, riboflavin-producing Bacillus subtilis strain. Reactions connecting the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis, catalyzed by the malic enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, consume up to 23% of the metabolized glucose. These are examples of important fluxes that can be accessed explicitly using a novel analysis based on synergistic application of flux balancing and recently introduced techniques of fractional C-13-labeling and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The overall flux distribution also suggests that B. subtilis metabolism has an unusually high capacity for the reoxidation of NADPH. Under the conditions investigated, riboflavin formation in B. subtilis is limited by the fluxes through the biosynthetic rather than the central carbon pathways, which suggests a focus for future metabolic engineering of this system.']","['enzymes', 'coli', 'enzyme', 'metabolic', 'metabolism', 'transhydrogenase', 'bacillus', 'glucose', 'glycogen', 'amino']",metabolite,Metabolism,Metabolism,bacillus,Enzyme Metabolism,Metabolic Enzymes,19

To analyze the role of PHO1 in transport of Pi, we have generated transgenic plants expressing PHO1 in ectopic A.thaliana tissues using an estradiol-inducible promoter. Leaves treated with estradiol showed strong PHO1 expression, leading to detectable accumulation of PHO1 protein. Estradiol-mediated induction of PHO1 in leaves from soil-grown plants, in leaves and roots of plants grown in liquid culture, or in leaf mesophyll protoplasts, was all accompanied by the specific release of Pi to the extracellular medium as early as 23 h after addition of estradiol. Net Pi export triggered by PHO1 induction was enhanced by high extracellular Pi and weakly inhibited by the proton-ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. Expression of a PHO1-GFP construct complementing the pho1 mutant revealed GFP expression in punctate structures in the pericycle cells but no fluorescence at the plasma membrane. When expressed in onion epidermal cells or in tobacco mesophyll cells, PHO1-GFP was associated with similar punctate structures that co-localized with the Golgi/trans-Golgi network and uncharacterized vesicles. However, PHO1-GFP could be partially relocated to the plasma membrane in leaves infiltrated with a high-phosphate solution. Together, these results show that PHO1 can trigger Pi export in ectopic plant cells, strongly indicating that PHO1 is itself a Pi exporter. Interestingly, PHO1-mediated Pi export was associated with its localization to the Golgi and trans-Golgi networks, revealing a role for these organelles in Pi transport.', 'Over-expression of PHO1 in Arabidopsis leaves reveals its role in mediating phosphate efflux P>Inorganic phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in multi-cellular eukaryotes depends not only on Pi influx into cells, but also on Pi efflux. Examples in plants for which Pi efflux is crucial are transfer of Pi into the xylem of roots and release of Pi at the peri-arbuscular interface of mycorrhizal roots. Despite its importance, no protein has been identified that specifically mediates phosphate efflux either in animals or plants. The Arabidopsis thaliana PHO1 gene is expressed in roots, and was previously shown to be involved in long-distance transfer of Pi from the root to the shoot. Here we show that PHO1 over-expression in the shoot of A. thaliana led to a two- to threefold increase in shoot Pi content and a severe reduction in shoot growth. 31P-NMR in vivo showed a normal initial distribution of intracellular Pi between the cytoplasm and the vacuole in leaves over-expressing PHO1, followed by a large efflux of Pi into the infiltration medium, leading to a rapid reduction of the vacuolar Pi pool. Furthermore, the Pi concentration in leaf xylem exudates from intact plants was more than 100-fold higher in PHO1 over-expressing plants compared to wild-type. Together, these results show that PHO1 over-expression in leaves leads to a dramatic efflux of Pi out of cells and into the xylem vessel, revealing a crucial role for PHO1 in Pi efflux.', 'Uncoupling phosphate deficiency from its major effects on growth and transcriptome via PHO1 expression in Arabidopsis P&gt;Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is one of the most limiting nutrients for plant growth in both natural and agricultural contexts. Pi-deficiency leads to a strong decrease in shoot growth, and triggers extensive changes at the developmental, biochemical and gene expression levels that are presumably aimed at improving the acquisition of this nutrient and sustaining growth. The Arabidopsis thaliana PHO1 gene has previously been shown to participate in the transport of Pi from roots to shoots, and the null pho1 mutant has all the hallmarks associated with shoot Pi deficiency. We show here that A. thaliana plants with a reduced expression of PHO1 in roots have shoot growth similar to Pi-sufficient plants, despite leaves being strongly Pi deficient. Furthermore, the gene expression profile normally triggered by Pi deficiency is suppressed in plants with low PHO1 expression. At comparable levels of shoot Pi supply, the wild type reduces shoot growth but maintains adequate shoot vacuolar Pi content, whereas the PHO1 underexpressor maintains maximal growth with strongly depleted Pi reserves. Expression of the Oryza sativa (rice) PHO1 ortholog in the pho1 null mutant also leads to plants that maintain normal growth and suppression of the Pi-deficiency response, despite the low shoot Pi. These data show that it is possible to unlink low shoot Pi content with the responses normally associated with Pi deficiency through the modulation of PHO1 expression or activity. These data also show that reduced shoot growth is not a direct consequence of Pi deficiency, but is more likely to be a result of extensive gene expression reprogramming triggered by Pi deficiency.']","['phosphate', 'phr1', 'pho1', 'arabidopsis', 'plant', 'plants', 'inorganic', 'cytosolic', 'pht4', 'ph']",phosphate,Phosphate,Phosphorus,phosphate,Phosphate Transport,Plant Phosphate Transport,19

Previous work has shown that this organism employs the CepIR quorum-sensing (QS) system to control the expression of virulence factors as well as the formation of biofilms. To date, however, very little is known about the QS-regulated virulence factors and virtually nothing about the factors that link QS and biofilm formation. Here, we have employed a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach to precisely define the QS regulon in our model strain B. cenocepacia H111, a CF isolate. Among the identified CepR-activated loci, three were analyzed in better detail for their roles in biofilm development: (i) a gene cluster coding for the BclACB lectins, (ii) the large surface protein BapA, and (iii) a type I pilus. The analysis of defined mutants revealed that BapA plays a major role in biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces while inactivation of the type I pilus showed little effect both in a static microtitre dish-based biofilm assay and in flow-through cells. Inactivation of the bclACB lectin genes resulted in biofilms containing hollow microcolonies, suggesting that the lectins are important for biofilm structural development.', 'Attenuation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence by quorum sensing inhibitors Traditional treatment of infectious diseases is based on compounds that kill or inhibit growth of bacteria. A major concern with this approach is the frequent development of resistance to antibiotics. The discovery of communication systems (quorum sensing systems) regulating bacterial virulence has afforded a novel opportunity to control infectious bacteria without interfering with growth. Compounds that can override communication signals have been found in the marine environment. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 as an example of an opportunistic human pathogen, we show that a synthetic derivate of natural furanone compounds can act as a potent antagonist of bacterial quorum sensing. We employed GeneChip((R)) microarray technology to identify furanone target genes and to map the quorum sensing regulon. The transcriptome analysis showed that the furanone drug specifically targeted quorum sensing systems and inhibited virulence factor expression. Application of the drug to P.aeruginosa biofilms increased bacterial susceptibility to tobramycin and SDS. In a mouse pulmonary infection model, the drug inhibited quorum sensing of the infecting bacteria and promoted their clearance by the mouse immune response.', 'Identification of quorum-sensing regulated proteins in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa by proteomics The Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen which is responsible for severe nosocomial infections in immunocompromised patients and is the major pathogen in cystic fibrosis. The bacterium utilizes two interrelated quorum-sensing (QS) systems, which rely on N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules, to control the expression of virulence factors and biofilm development. In this study, we compared the protein patterns of the intracellular, extracellular and surface protein fractions of the PAO1 parent strain with those of an isogenic lasI rhlI double mutant by means of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). This analysis showed that the intensities of 23.7% of all detected protein spots differed more than 2.5-fold between the two strains. We only considered those protein spots truly QS regulated that were changed in the mutant in the absence of signal molecules but were rescued to the wild-type situation when the medium was supplemented with AHLs. These protein spots were characterized by MALDI-TOF peptide mapping. Twenty-seven proteins were identified that were previously reported to be AHL controlled, among them several well-characterized virulence factors. For one of the identified proteins, the serine protease PrpL, a biochemical assay was established to verify that expression of this factor is indeed QS regulated. Furthermore, it is shown that the quorum-sensing blocker C-30 specifically interferes with the expression of 67% of the AHL-controlled protein spots of the surface fraction, confirming the high specificity of the compound. Importantly, 20 novel QS-regulated proteins were identified, many of which are involved in iron utilization, suggesting a link between quorum sensing and the iron regulatory system. Two of these proteins, PhuR and HasAp, are components of the two distinct haem-uptake systems present in P. aeruginosa. In agreement with the finding that both proteins are positively regulated by the QS cascade, we show that the lasI rhlI double mutant grows poorly with haemoglobin as the only iron source when compared with the wild type. These results add haemoglobin utilization to the list of phenotypes controlled through QS in P. aeruginosa. The surprisingly high number of AHL-regulated proteins relative to the number of regulated genes suggests that quorum-sensing control also operates via post-transcriptional mechanisms. To strengthen this hypothesis we investigated the role of quorum sensing in the post-translational modification of HasAp, an extracellular protein required for the uptake of free and haemoglobin-bound haem.']","['pseudomonas', 'bacteria', 'bacterial', 'pathogens', 'pathogen', 'biofilms', 'pathogenicity', 'biofilm', 'infections', 'infection']",pathogens,Pathogens,Bacteria,pathogens,Pseudomonas Pathogens,Bacterial Pathogens,19

Region-Specific Selection on Floral Scent in a Terrestrial Orchid Geographically structured phenotypic selection can lead to adaptive divergence. However, in flowering plants, such divergent selection has rarely been shown, and selection on floral signals is generally little understood. In this study, we measured phenotypic selection on display size, floral color, and floral scent in four lowland and four mountain populations of the nectar-rewarding terrestrial orchid Gymnadenia odoratissima in two years. We also quantified population differences in these traits and pollinator community composition. Our results show positive selection on display size and positive, negative, or absence of selection on different scent compounds and floral color. Selection on the main scent compounds was consistently stronger in the lowlands than in the mountains, and lowland plants emitted higher amounts of most of these compounds. Pollinator community composition also differed between regions, suggesting different pollinators select for differences in floral volatiles. Overall, our study is the first to document consistent regional differences in selection on floral scent, suggesting this pattern of selection is one of the evolutionary forces contributing to regional divergence in floral chemical signaling.', 'Hybrid floral scent novelty drives pollinator shift in sexually deceptive orchids Background: Sexually deceptive orchids of the genus Ophrys attract their pollinators, male insects, on a highly specific basis through the emission of odour blends that mimic the female sex pheromone of the targeted species. In this study, we have investigated a contact site between Ophrys arachnitiformis and O. lupercalis, two sympatric orchid species that are usually reproductively isolated via the exploitation of different pollinator ""niches"", but occasionally hybridise despite their apparent combination of ethological and mechanical isolation barriers. In particular, we have investigated the extent to which these Ophrys hybrids generate ""emergent"" combinations (i.e. novel and unpredictable from the parents\' phenotypes) of floral traits, and how these phenotypic novelties, particularly the odour blends emitted by the flower, could facilitate the invasion of a novel pollinator ""niche"" and induce the rapid formation of reproductive isolation, a prerequisite for adaptive evolutionary divergence. Conclusions: Collectively, our results illustrate that the process of hybridisation can lead to the generation of evolutionary novelties, and that novel combinations of floral traits can drive pollinator shifts and rapid reproductive isolation in highly specific plant-pollinator interactions. Results: Our chemical analyses of floral scents show that the Ophrys F1 hybrids investigated here produce more compounds, significantly different ratios (% of odour compounds in the total blend), as well as new compounds in their floral odour compared to their progenitors. When tested for their attractiveness to the pollinator of each parent orchid species, we found that floral scent extracts of the hybrids triggered less inspecting flights and contacts by the male bees with the scented dummy than those of the parental orchid species. However, a series of additional behavioural bioassays revealed that the novel floral scent of the hybrids was significantly more attractive than either of the two parents to a pollinator species not initially involved in the pollination of any of the parent Ophrys species.', ""FLORAL ISOLATION IS THE MAIN REPRODUCTIVE BARRIER AMONG CLOSELY RELATED SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHIDS Floral isolation is an important component of pollinator-driven speciation. However, up to now, only a few studies have quantified its strength and relative contribution to total reproductive isolation. In this study, we quantified floral isolation among three closely related, sympatric orchid species of the genus Ophrys by directly tracking pollen flow. Ophrys orchids mimic their pollinators' mating signals, and are pollinated by male insects during mating attempts. This pollination system, called sexual deception, is usually highly specific. However, whether pollinator specialization also conveys floral isolation is currently under debate. In this study, we found strong floral isolation: among 46 tracked pollen transfers in two flowering seasons, all occurred within species. Accounting for observation error rate, we estimated a floral isolation index >= 0.98 among each pair of species. Hand pollination experiments suggested that postpollination barriers were effectively absent among our study species. Genetic analysis based on AFLP markers showed a clear species clustering and very few F-1 hybrids in natural populations, providing independent evidence that strong floral isolation prevents significant interspecies gene flow.

The deduced amino acid sequence is highly related to that of higher plants and cyanobacteria. Using a particle gun, wild type C. reinhardtii cells have been transformed with a plasmid carrying the psaC gene disrupted by an aadA gene cassette designed to express spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance in the chloroplast. Transformants selected on plates containing acetate as a reduced carbon source and spectinomycin are unable to grow on minimal medium lacking acetate and are deficient in PSI activity. Southern blot analysis of total cell DNA of the transformants shows that the wild type psaC gene has been replaced by the interrupted psaC gene through homologous recombination. While authentic transcripts of the psaC gene are no longer detected, aadA gives rise to a few transcripts in the transformants. Biochemical analysis indicates that neither PSI reaction center subunits nor the seven small subunits belonging to PSI accumulate stably in the thylakoid membranes of the transformants.  Pulse-chase labeling of cell proteins shows that the PSI reaction center subunits are synthesized normally but turn over rapidly in the transformants. We conclude that the iron sulfur binding protein encoded by the psaC gene is an essential component, both for photochemical activity and for stable assembly of PSI. The present study suggests that any chloroplast gene encoding a component of the photosynthetic apparatus can be disrupted in C. reinhardtii using the strategy described.', 'Chloroplast site-directed mutagenesis of photosystem I in Chlamydomonas: Electron transfer reactions and light sensitivity The photosystem I (PSI) complex is a multisubunit protein-pigment complex embedded in the thylakoid membrane which acts as a light-driven plastocyanin/cytochrome c(6)-ferredoxin oxido-reductase. The use of chloroplast transformation and site-directed mutagenesis coupled with the biochemical and biophysical analysis of mutants of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with specific amino acid changes in several subunits of PSI has provided new insights into the structure-function relationship of this important photosynthetic complex. In particular, this molecular-genetic analysis has identified key residues of the reaction center polypeptides of PSI which are the ligands of some of the redox cofactors and it has also provided important insights into the orientation of the terminal electron accepters of this complex. Finally this analysis has also shown that mutations affecting the donor side of PSI are limiting for overall electron transfer under high light and that electron trapping within the terminal electron accepters of PSI is highly deleterious to the cells.

Several symptoms commonly seen in CDG-Ia such as inverted nipples, abnormal fat distribution, and cerebellar hypoplasia were not observed. The clinical course is milder overall, with a better neurological outcome, than in CDG-Ia. The isoelectric focusing pattern of serum transferrin in CDG-Ia and CDG-Ic is indistinguishable.

Actually, some 42 CDG are known including defects in protein N-glycosylation, in protein O-glycosylation, in lipid glycosylation, and in multiple and other glycosylation pathways. Most CDG are multisystem diseases and a large number of signs and symptoms have already been reported in CDG. An exception to this is deafness. This symptom has not been observed as a consistent feature in CDG. In 2008, a novel defect was identified in protein N-glycosylation, namely in RFT1. This is a defect in the assembly of N-glycans. RFT1 is involved in the transfer of Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol from the cytoplasmic to the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. According to the novel nomenclature (non-italicized gene symbol followed by -CDG) this defect is named RFT1-CDG. Recently, three other patients with RFT1-CDG have been reported and here we report two novel patients. Remarkably, all six patients with RFT1-CDG show sensorineural deafness as part of a severe neurological syndrome. We conclude that RFT1-CDG is the first 'deafness-CDG'.

The BH3-only proteins have been proposed to activate pro-apoptotic members of the Bax subfamily to trigger a mitochondrial pathway that leads to the release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors. Here we report that the mechanism of action of Bim is different from that of Bid. Although overexpression of Bid or Bim in cells leads to cytochrome c release, only Bid is able to trigger the release of cytochrome c through Bax activation when added directly to isolated mitochondria. Bim(L), although unable to activate Bax, can directly inhibit Bcl-2 or Bcl-X-L. Our data suggest two functional classes of BH3-only proteins: those such as Bid which directly activate Bax-like proteins leading to mitochondrial membrane permeability and apoptosis and those such as Bim which inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins and render the cells more susceptible to apoptogenic stimuli.

Bax oligomerization can also be induced by incubating isolated mitochondria containing endogenous Bax with recombinant tBid (caspase-8-cleaved Bid) in vitro. The mechanism by which Bax oligomerizes under these conditions is still unknown. To address this question, recombinant human full-length Bax was purified as a monomeric protein. Bax failed to oligomerize spontaneously in isolated mitochondria or in liposomes composed of either, cardiolipin or lipids extracted from mitochondria. However, in the presence of tBid, the protein formed large complexes in mitochondrial membranes and induced the release of cytochrome c. tBid also induced Bax oligomerization in isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, but not in other membranes, such as plasma membranes or microsomes. Moreover, tBid-induced Bax oligomerization was inhibited when mitochondria were pretreated with protease K. The presence of the voltage-dependent anion channel was not required either for Bax oligomerization or for Bax-induced cytochrome c release. Finally, Bax oligomerization was reconstituted in proteoliposomes made from mitochondrial membrane proteins. These findings imply that tBid is necessary but not sufficient for Bax oligomerization; a mitochondrial protein is also required.', 'Bid-induced conformational change of Bax is responsible for mitochondrial cytochrome c release during apoptosis Here we report that in staurosporine-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells, Bid, a BH3 domain containing protein, translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria. This event is associated with a change in conformation of Bax which leads to the unmasking of its NH2-terminal domain and is accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. A similar finding is reported for cerebellar granule cells undergoing apoptosis induced by serum and potassium deprivation. The Bax-conformational change is prevented by Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) but not by caspase inhibitors. Using isolated mitochondria and various BH3 mutants of Bid, we demonstrate that direct binding of Bid to Bax is a prerequisite for Bax structural change and cytochrome c release. Bcl-x(L) can inhibit the effect of Bid by interacting directly with Bax. Moreover, using mitochondria from Bax-deficient tumor cell lines, we show that Bid-induced release of cytochrome c is negligible when Bid is added alone, but dramatically increased when Bid and Bax are added together. Taken together, our results suggest that, during certain types of apoptosis. Bid translocates to mitochondria and binds to Bax, leading to a change in conformation of Bax and to cytochrome c release from mitochondria.']","['mitochondrial', 'mitochondria', 'apoptosis', 'kinase', 'cells', 'membrane', 'bcl', 'cell', 'proteins', 'apoptotic']",apoptosis,Apoptosis,Apoptosis,apoptosis,Mitochondrial Apoptosis,Mitochondrial Apoptosis,19

The rate-limiting step in the action of TDG in vitro is its dissociation from the product AP site, suggesting the existence of a specific enzyme release mechanism in vivo. We show here that TDG interacts with and is covalently modified by the ubiquitin-like proteins SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3. SUMO conjugation dramatically reduces the DNA substrate and AP site binding affinity of TDG, and this is associated with a significant increase in enzymatic turnover in reactions with a G.U substrate and the loss of G.T processing activity.

The underlying brain damage includes apoptosis of neurons in the hippocampus and necrosis in the cortex. Therapeutic options to reduce acute injury and to improve outcome from PM are severely limited. With the aim to develop new therapies a number of pharmacologic interventions have been evaluated. However, the often unpredictable outcome of interventional studies suggests that the current concept of the pathophysiologic events during bacterial meningitis is fragmentary. The aim of this work is to describe the transcriptomic changes underlying the complex mechanisms of the host response to pneumococcal meningitis in a temporal and spatial context using a well characterized infant rat model. Methods: Eleven days old nursing Wistar rats were infected by direct intracisternal injection of 2 x 10(6)cfu/ml of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 10 and 26 days after infection, the brain harvested and the cortex and hippocampus were sampled. The first two time points represent the acute and sub-acute phase of bacterial meningitis, whereas the latter represent the recovery phase of the disease. Conclusions: Here we describe the cellular pathways involved in the host response to experimental pneumococcal meningitis in specified disease states and brain regions. With these results we hope to provide the scientific basis for the development of new treatment strategies which take the temporal aspects of the disease into account. Results: The major events in the regulation of the host response on a transcriptional level occur within the first 3 days after infection. Beyond this time, no differences in global gene expression in infected and control animals were detectable by microarray analysis.

Ex vivo cultures of human breast cancer tissue have been proposed to retain the original tissue architecture, epithelial and stromal cell components and ER alpha. However, loss of cellularity, viability and ER alpha expression are well-known culture-related phenomena. Methods BC samples were collected and brought to the laboratory. Then they were minced, enzymatically digested, entrapped in alginate and cultured for 1 month. The histological architecture, cellular composition and cell proliferation of tissue microstructures were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Cell viability was assessed by measurement of cell metabolic activity and histological evaluation. The presence of ER alpha was accessed by immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR and its functionality evaluated by challenge with 17-beta-estradiol and fulvestrant. Results We describe a strategy based on entrapment of breast cancer tissue microstructures in alginate capsules and their long-term culture under agitation, successfully applied to tissue obtained from 63 breast cancer patients. After 1 month in culture, the architectural features of the encapsulated tissue microstructures were similar to the original patient tumors: epithelial, stromal and endothelial compartments were maintained, with an average of 97% of cell viability compared to day 0. In ER alpha-positive cases, fibers of collagen, the main extracellular matrix component in vivo, were preserved. ER alpha expression was at least partially retained at gene and protein levels and response to ER alpha stimulation and inhibition was observed at the level of downstream targets, demonstrating active ER signaling. Conclusions The proposed model system is a new methodology to study ex vivo breast cancer biology, in particular ER alpha signaling. It is suitable for interrogating the long-term effects of anti-endocrine drugs in a set-up that closely resembles the original tumor microenvironment, with potential application in pre- and co-clinical assays of ER alpha-positive breast cancer.', 'Estrogen receptor positive breast cancers have patient specific hormone sensitivities and rely on progesterone receptor The role of progesterone receptor (PR) and its interplay with estrogen receptor (ER) in breast cancer is controversial. Here, the authors demonstrate that PR can have an ER-independent role in breast cancer growth and metastasis and that its effects are dependent on MYC and androgen receptor signatures. Estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER, PR) signaling control breast development and impinge on breast carcinogenesis. ER is an established driver of ER + disease but the role of the PR, itself an ER target gene, is debated. We assess the issue in clinically relevant settings by a genetic approach and inject ER + breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumor cells to the milk ducts of immunocompromised mice. Such ER + xenografts were exposed to physiologically relevant levels of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4). We find that independently both premenopausal E2 and P4 levels increase tumor growth and combined treatment enhances metastatic spread. The proliferative responses are patient-specific with MYC and androgen receptor (AR) signatures determining P4 response. PR is required for tumor growth in patient samples and sufficient to drive tumor growth and metastasis in ER signaling ablated tumor cells. Our findings suggest that endocrine therapy may need to be personalized, and that abrogating PR expression can be a therapeutic option.']","['estrogens', 'estrogen', 'breast', 'cancers', 'cancer', 'hormones', 'hormone', 'oestrogen', 'androgen', 'tumors']",estrogen,Hormones,Hormones,estrogen,Hormonal Cancers,Hormone-Related Cancers,19

Genetic and antigenic variation in HA has been used to classify influenza viruses into subtypes (H1-H16). The neutralizing antibody response to influenza virus is thought to be specific for a few antigenically related isolates within a given subtype. However, while heterosubtypic antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple influenza virus subtypes have been recently isolated from phage display libraries, it is not known whether such antibodies are produced in the course of an immune response to influenza virus infection or vaccine. Here we report that, following vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccine containing H1 and H3 influenza virus subtypes, some individuals produce antibodies that cross-react with H5 HA. By immortalizing IgG-expressing B cells from 4 individuals, we isolated 20 heterosubtypic mAbs that bound and neutralized viruses belonging to several HA subtypes (H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9), including the pandemic A/California/07/09 H1N1 isolate. The mAbs used different VH genes and carried a high frequency of somatic mutations. With the exception of a mAb that bound to the HA globular head, all heterosubtypic mAbs bound to acid-sensitive epitopes in the HA stem region. Four mAbs were evaluated in vivo and protected mice from challenge with influenza viruses representative of different subtypes. These findings reveal that seasonal influenza vaccination can induce polyclonal heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies that cross-react with the swine-origin pandemic H1N1 influenza virus and with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.', 'Human host factors required for influenza virus replication Influenza A virus is an RNA virus that encodes up to 11 proteins and this small coding capacity demands that the virus use the host cellular machinery for many aspects of its life cycle(1). Knowledge of these host cell requirements not only informs us of the molecular pathways exploited by the virus but also provides further targets that could be pursued for antiviral drug development. Here we use an integrative systems approach, based on genome-wide RNA interference screening, to identify 295 cellular cofactors required for early-stage influenza virus replication. Within this group, those involved in kinase-regulated signalling, ubiquitination and phosphatase activity are the most highly enriched, and 181 factors assemble into a highly significant host-pathogen interaction network. Moreover, 219 of the 295 factors were confirmed to be required for efficient wild-type influenza virus growth, and further analysis of a subset of genes showed 23 factors necessary for viral entry, including members of the vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) and COPI-protein families, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) proteins, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-beta. Furthermore, 10 proteins were confirmed to be involved in post-entry steps of influenza virus replication. These include nuclear import components, proteases, and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) II beta (CAMK2B). Notably, growth of swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus is also dependent on the identified host factors, and we show that small molecule inhibitors of several factors, including vATPase and CAMK2B, antagonize influenza virus replication.', 'Influenza Virus Sequence Feature Variant Type Analysis: Evidence of a Role for NS1 in Influenza Virus Host Range Restriction Genetic drift of influenza virus genomic sequences occurs through the combined effects of sequence alterations introduced by a low-fidelity polymerase and the varying selective pressures experienced as the virus migrates through different host environments. While traditional phylogenetic analysis is useful in tracking the evolutionary heritage of these viruses, the specific genetic determinants that dictate important phenotypic characteristics are often difficult to discern within the complex genetic background arising through evolution. Here we describe a novel influenza virus sequence feature variant type (Flu-SFVT) approach, made available through the public Influenza Research Database resource (www.fludb.org), in which variant types (VTs) identified in defined influenza virus protein sequence features (SFs) are used for genotype-phenotype association studies. Since SFs have been defined for all influenza virus proteins based on known structural, functional, and immune epitope recognition properties, the Flu-SFVT approach allows the rapid identification of the molecular genetic determinants of important influenza virus characteristics and their connection to underlying biological functions. We demonstrate the use of the SFVT approach to obtain statistical evidence for effects of NS1 protein sequence variations in dictating influenza virus host range restriction.']","['influenza', 'viruses', 'antivirals', 'virus', 'viral', 'antiviral', 'vaccine', 'antigenic', 'vaccines', 'h1n1']",influenza,Influenza,influenza,influenza,Influenza Viruses,Influenza and Antivirals,19
87,126,87_coevolutionary_evolutionary_ecosystems_ecological,"['Dendritic network structure and dispersal affect temporal dynamics of diversity and species persistence Landscape connectivity structure, specifically the dendritic network structure of rivers, is expected to influence community diversity dynamics by altering dispersal patterns, and subsequently the unfolding of species interactions. However, previous comparative and experimental work on dendritic metacommunities has studied diversity mostly from an equilibrium perspective. Here we investigated the effect of dendritic versus linear network structure on local (alpha-diversity), among (beta-diversity) and total (gamma-diversity) temporal species community diversity dynamics. Using a combination of microcosm experiments, which allowed for active dispersal of 14 protists and a rotifer species, and numerical analyses, we demonstrate the general importance of spatial network configuration and basic life history tradeoffs as driving factors of different diversity patterns in linear and dendritic systems. We experimentally found that community diversity patterns were shaped by the interaction of dispersal within the networks and local species interactions. Specifically, alpha-diversity remained higher in dendritic networks over time, especially at highly connected sites. beta-diversity was initially greater in linear networks, due to increased dispersal limitation, but became more similar to beta-diversity in dendritic networks over time. Comparing the experimental results with a neutral metacommunity model we found that dispersal and network connectivity alone may, to a large extent, explain alpha- and beta-diversity dynamics. However, additional mechanisms, such as variation in carrying capacity and competition-colonization tradeoffs, were needed in the model to capture the detailed temporal diversity dynamics of the experiments, such as a general decline in gamma-diversity and long-term dynamics in alpha-diversity.', 'Active colonization dynamics and diversity patterns are influenced by dendritic network connectivity and species interactions Habitat network connectivity influences colonization dynamics, species invasions, and biodiversity patterns. Recent theoretical work suggests dendritic networks, such as those found in rivers, alter expectations regarding colonization and dispersal dynamics compared with other network types. As many native and non-native species are spreading along river networks, this may have important ecological implications. However, experimental studies testing the effects of network structure on colonization and diversity patterns are scarce. Up to now, experimental studies have only considered networks where sites are connected with small corridors, or dispersal was experimentally controlled, which eliminates possible effects of species interactions on colonization dynamics. Here, we tested the effect of network connectivity and species interactions on colonization dynamics using continuous linear and dendritic (i.e., river-like) networks, which allow for active dispersal. We used a set of six protist species and one rotifer species in linear and dendritic microcosm networks. At the start of the experiment, we introduced species, either singularly or as a community within the networks. Species subsequently actively colonized the networks. We periodically measured densities of species throughout the networks over 2weeks to track community dynamics, colonization, and diversity patterns. We found that colonization of dendritic networks was faster compared with colonization of linear networks, which resulted in higher local mean species richness in dendritic networks. Initially, community similarity was also greater in dendritic networks compared with linear networks, but this effect vanished over time. The presence of species interactions increased community evenness over time, compared with extrapolations from single-species setups. Our experimental findings confirm previous theoretical work and show that network connectivity, species-specific dispersal ability, and species interactions greatly influence the dispersal and colonization of dendritic networks. We argue that these factors need to be considered in empirical studies, where effects of network connectivity on colonization patterns have been largely underestimated.', 'Dispersal in dendritic networks: Ecological consequences on the spatial distribution of population densities 5. We show that differences in network structure alone can cause characteristic spatial variation in population densities. While such differences have been postulated by theoretical work and are the underlying precondition for differential dispersal evolution in heterogeneous networks, our results may be the first experimental demonstration thereof. Furthermore, these population-level dynamics may affect extinction risks and can upscale to previously shown metacommunity level diversity dynamics. Given that many species in natural river systems exhibit strong spatiotemporal patterns in population densities, our work suggests that abundance patterns should not only be addressed from a local environmental perspective, but may be the outcome of processes that are inherently driven by the respective habitat network structure. 4. At the end of the experiment, we found more variable population densities between patches in dendritic networks compared to linear networks, as predicted by theory. Specifically, in dendritic networks, population densities were higher at nodes that connected to headwaters compared to the headwaters themselves and to more central nodes in the network. These differences follow theoretical predictions and emerged from the different network topologies per se. These differences in population densities emerged despite weakly density-dependent movement. 3. We conducted replicated microcosm experiments, in which we manipulated the spatially explicit network configuration of a landscape and addressed how linear versus dendritic connectivity affects population dynamics, specifically the spatial distribution of population densities, and movement behaviour of the protist model organism Tetrahymena pyriformis. We tracked population densities and individual-level movement behaviour of thousands of individuals over time. 2. Much of the previous work on ecological and evolutionary dynamics in metapopulations and metacommunities in dendritic river networks has been either using comparative approaches or was purely theoretical. However, the use of microcosm experiments provides the unique opportunity to study large-scale questions in a causal and experimental framework. 1. Understanding the consequences of spatial structure on ecological dynamics is a central theme in ecology. Recently, research has recognised the relevance of river and river-analogue network structures, because these systems are not only highly diverse but also rapidly changing due to habitat modifications or species invasions.']","['coevolutionary', 'evolutionary', 'ecosystems', 'ecological', 'networks', 'dispersal', 'species', 'metapopulation', 'phylogenetic', 'communities']",biodiversity,Coevolution,coevolution,biodiversity,Coevolutionary Ecosystems,Evolutionary Ecology,19

In both environments, the bacterium is subject to interbacterial competition. A molecular nanomachine that is often involved in such competitive behavior is the type VI secretion system (T6SS). Interestingly and in contrast to non-pandemic or environmental isolates, the T6SS of the O1 El Tor clade of V. cholerae, which is responsible for the ongoing 7th cholera pandemic, is largely silent under standard laboratory culture conditions. Instead, these strains induce their full T6SS capacity only under specific conditions such as growth on chitinous surfaces (signaled through TfoX and QstR) or when the cells encounter low intracellular c-di-GMP levels (TfoY-driven). In this study, we identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within an intergenic region of the major T6SS gene cluster of V. cholerae that determines the T6SS status of the cell. We show that SNP conversion is sufficient to induce T6SS production in numerous pandemic strains, while the converse approach renders non-pandemic/environmental V. cholerae strains T6SS-silent. We further demonstrate that SNP-dependent T6SS production occurs independently of the known T6SS regulators TfoX, QstR, and TfoY. Finally, we identify a putative promoter region adjacent to the identified SNP that is required for all forms of T6SS regulation in V. cholerae.', 'Competence-induced type VI secretion might foster intestinal colonization by Vibrio cholerae: Intestinal interbacterial killing by competence-induced V-cholerae The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae exhibits two distinct lifestyles: one in the aquatic environment where it often associates with chitinous surfaces and the other as the causative agent of the disease cholera. While much of the research on V. cholerae has focused on the host-pathogen interaction, knowledge about the environmental lifestyle of the pathogen remains limited. We recently showed that the polymer chitin, which is extremely abundant in aquatic environments, induces natural competence as a mode of horizontal gene transfer and that this competence regulon also includes the type VI secretion system (T6SS), a molecular killing device. Here, I discuss the putative consequences that chitin-induced T6SS activation could have on intestinal colonization and how the transmission route might influence disease outcome. Moreover, I propose that common infant animal models for cholera might not sufficiently take into account T6SS-mediated interbacterial warfare between V. cholerae and the intestinal microbiota.', 'The type VI secretion system of Vibrio cholerae fosters horizontal gene transfer Natural competence for transformation is a common mode of horizontal gene transfer and contributes to bacterial evolution. Transformation occurs through the uptake of external DNA and its integration into the genome. Here we show that the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which serves as a predatory killing device, is part of the competence regulon in the naturally transformable pathogen Vibrio cholerae. The T6SS-encoding gene cluster is under the positive control of the competence regulators TfoX and QstR and is induced by growth on chitinous surfaces. Live-cell imaging revealed that deliberate killing of nonimmune cells via competence-mediated induction of T6SS releases DNA and makes it accessible for horizontal gene transfer in V. cholerae.']","['cholerae', 'pathogens', 'bacteremia', 'cholera', 'pathogen', 'bacterial', 'bacteria', 'virulence', 'vibrio', 'interbacterial']",cholera,Vibrio,bacteria,cholera,Cholera Pathogens,Bacterial Pathogens,19

A study was performed to investigate the association between positive viral detection and respiratory infection in an at-risk population. Results: Of 522 BAL fluid specimens analysed, 81% were collected in adult transplant recipients or other immuno-compromised patients. Overall, PCR assays identified viral nucleic acid in 91 BAL fluid samples (17.4%). Similar rates of virus-positive BAL fluid were found in the different subpopulations studied (p=0.113). Coronaviruses were the most frequent (32.3%), followed by rhinovirus (22.6%), parainfluenza (19.5%), influenza (9.7%), respiratory synctial virus (8.6%), human metapneumovirus (4.2%) and bocavirus (3.1%). Multivariate analysis using mixed models showed that respiratory viral infections were associated with a lack of antibiotic treatment response (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1) and the absence of radiological infiltrate (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.8). In lung transplant recipients in whom a respiratory infection was suspected, the respiratory viral detection rate was 24.4% compared with 13.8% overall in other patients (p=0.02). Methods: 299 adult patients who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedures were enrolled in a hospital-based prospective cohort study. Descriptive epidemiology is presented of 17 different respiratory viruses detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays in BAL fluid specimens. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify the clinical characteristics independently associated with the presence of virus. Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalised adults, respiratory viruses detected in BAL fluid specimens were associated with respiratory symptoms, absence of radiological infiltrates and a poor response to antibiotic therapy.', 'Propagation of respiratory viruses in human airway epithelia reveals persistent virus-specific signatures Conclusion: Our results highlight the differential in vitro pathogenesis of respiratory viruses during the acute infection phase and their ability to persist under immune tolerance. These data help to appreciate the range of disease severity observed in vivo and the occurrence of chronic respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts. Objective: We sought to compare infections by respiratory viruses isolated from clinical specimens using reconstituted human airway epithelia. Results: RVs, RSV-B, and HCoV-OC43 infected ciliated cells and caused no major cell death, whereas H3N2 and EV-D68 induced ciliated cell loss and tissue integrity disruption. H3N2 was also detected in rare goblet and basal cells. All viruses, except RV-B48 and HCoV-OC43, altered cilia beating and mucociliary clearance. H3N2 was the strongest cytokine inducer, and HCoV-OC43 was the weakest. Persistent infection was observed in all cases. RNA sequencing highlighted perturbation of tissue metabolism and induction of a transient but important immune response at 4 days after infection. No majority mutations emerged in the viral population. Methods: Tissues were infected with RV-A55, RV-A49, RV-B48, RV-C8, and RV-C15; respiratory EV-D68; influenza virus H3N2; RSV-B; and human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43. Replication kinetics, cell tropism, effect on tissue integrity, and cytokine secretion were compared. Viral adaptation and tissue response were assessed through RNA sequencing. Background: The leading cause of acute illnesses, respiratory viruses, typically cause self-limited diseases, although severe complications can occur in fragile patients. Rhinoviruses (RVs), respiratory enteroviruses (EVs), influenza virus, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs), and coronaviruses are highly prevalent respiratory pathogens, but because of the lack of reliable animal models, their differential pathogenesis remains poorly characterized.', ""Rhinovirus Genome Variation during Chronic Upper and Lower Respiratory Tract Infections Routine screening of lung transplant recipients and hospital patients for respiratory virus infections allowed to identify human rhinovirus (HRV) in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, including immunocompromised hosts chronically infected with the same strain over weeks or months. Phylogenetic analysis of 144 HRV-positive samples showed no apparent correlation between a given viral genotype or species and their ability to invade the lower respiratory tract or lead to protracted infection. By contrast, protracted infections were found almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, thus suggesting that host factors rather than the virus genotype modulate disease outcome, in particular the immune response. Complete genome sequencing of five chronic cases to study rhinovirus genome adaptation showed that the calculated mutation frequency was in the range observed during acute human infections. Analysis of mutation hot spot regions between specimens collected at different times or in different body sites revealed that non-synonymous changes were mostly concentrated in the viral capsid genes VP1, VP2 and VP3, independent of the HRV type. In an immunosuppressed lung transplant recipient infected with the same HRV strain for more than two years, both classical and ultra-deep sequencing of samples collected at different time points in the upper and lower respiratory tracts showed that these virus populations were phylogenetically indistinguishable over the course of infection, except for the last month. Specific signatures were found in the last two lower respiratory tract populations, including changes in the 5'UTR polypyrimidine tract and the VP2 immunogenic site 2.

Certain taxa, however, still have an uncertain phylogenetic position, including the common and conspicuous species Nebela militaris. A phylogenetic reconstruction of the Hyalospheniidae using partial sequences of the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit 1 (COI) gene shows that N. militaris does not belong to genus Nebela, but should be placed in its own genus.

The testate amoeba genus Quadrulella produces self-secreted, siliceous plates with a very characteristic square shapesuch plates were assumed to be synapomorphic of the genus. Here we demonstrate that Quadrulella symmetrica (the most common Holarctic species) is not monophyletic.

Based on morphology and sequence data, we describe Quadrulella variabilis sp. nov. from Switzerland, and Quadrulella madibai sp. nov. from South Africa, and confirm the validity of Q.alata. The former species Q.subcarinata does not belong to the genus Quadrulella. We therefore transfer this species to the new genus Mrabella gen. nov. Our results show that hyalosphenids presenting siliceous square shell plates do not form a monophyletic clade. Several possible hypotheses about the origins of square plates are discussed. Additionally, this comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the family Hyalospheniidae confirms that the genus Nebela is paraphyletic and needs to be divided into genera based on general shell shape: Nebela sensu stricto, Longinebela gen. nov., Planocarina gen. nov., Gibbocarina gen. nov., Cornutheca gen. nov. and Mrabella gen. nov.', 'COI Barcoding of Nebelid Testate Amoebae (Amoebozoa: Arcellinida): Extensive Cryptic Diversity and Redefinition of the Hyalospheniidae Schultze We used Cytochrome Oxidase Subunit 1 (COI) to assess the phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy of Nebela sensu stricto and similar taxa (Nebela group, Arcellinida) in order to clarify the taxonomic validity of morphological characters. The COI data not only successfully separated all studied morphospecies but also revealed the existence of several potential cryptic species. The taxonomic implications of the results are: (1) Genus Nebela is paraphyletic and will need to be split into at least two monophyletic assemblages when taxon sampling is further expanded. (2) Genus Quadrulella, one of the few arcellinid genera building its shell from self-secreted siliceous elements, and the mixotrophic Hyalosphenia papilio branch within the Nebela group in agreement with the general morphology of their shell and the presence of an organic rim around the aperture (synapomorphy for Hyalospheniidae).

Combined results of all four methods served as a diagnostic 'gold' standard and revealed prevalences of S. mansoni, hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, Strongyloides stercoralis and Ascaris lumbricoides of 83.0%, 55.4%, 40.2%, 33.9% and 28.6%, respectively. A single FLOTAC from stool samples preserved in sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin for 30 or 83 days showed a higher sensitivity for S. mansoni diagnosis (91.4%) than the ether-concentration method on stool samples preserved for 40 days (85.0%) or triplicate Kato-Katz using fresh stool samples (77.4%). Moreover, a single FLOTAC detected hookworm, A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura infections with a higher sensitivity than any of the other methods used, but resulted in lower egg counts. The Koga agar plate method was the most accurate diagnostic assay for S. stercoralis. Background: Infections with schistosomes and soil-transmitted helminths exert a considerable yet underappreciated economic and public health burden on afflicted populations. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for patient management, drug efficacy evaluations, and monitoring of large-scale community-based control programs. Conclusion/Significance: We have shown that the FLOTAC method holds promise for the diagnosis of S. mansoni. Moreover, our study confirms that FLOTAC is a sensitive technique for detection of common soil-transmitted helminths. For the diagnosis of S. stercoralis, the Koga agar plate method remains the method of choice."", 'How Long Can Stool Samples Be Fixed for an Accurate Diagnosis of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infection Using Mini-FLOTAC? Principal Findings Conclusions/Significance The study was carried out in late 2013 on Pemba Island, Tanzania. Forty-one children were enrolled and stool samples were subjected on the day of collection to a single Kato-Katz thick smear and Mini-FLOTAC examination; 12 aliquots of stool were fixed in 5% formalin and subsequently examined by Mini-FLOTAC up to 31 days after collection. Kato-Katz is a widely used method for the diagnosis of soil-transmitted helminth infection. Fecal samples cannot be preserved, and hence, should be processed on the day of collection and examined under a microscope within 60 min of slide preparation. Mini-FLOTAC is a technique that allows examining fixed fecal samples. We assessed the performance of Mini-FLOTAC using formalin-fixed stool samples compared to Kato-Katz and determined the dynamics of prevalence and intensity estimates of soil-transmitted helminth infection over a 31-day time period. The findings of our study suggest that for a qualitative diagnosis of soil-transmitted helminth infection, stool samples can be fixed in 5% formalin for at least 30 days. However, for an accurate quantitative diagnosis of hookworm, we suggest a limit of 15 days of preservation. Our results have direct implication for integrating soil-transmitted helminthiasis into transmission assessment surveys for lymphatic filariasis. Background Methodology The combined results from Kato-Katz and Mini-FLOTAC revealed that 100% of children were positive for Trichuris trichiura, 85% for Ascaris lumbricoides, and 54% for hookworm. Kato-Katz and Mini-FLOTAC techniques found similar prevalence estimates for A. lumbricoides (85% versus 76%), T. trichiura (98% versus 100%), and hookworm (42% versus 51%). The mean eggs per gram of stool (EPG) according to Kato-Katz and Mini-FLOTAC was 12,075 and 11,679 for A. lumbricoides, 1,074 and 1,592 for T. trichiura, and 255 and 220 for hookworm, respectively. The mean EPG from day 1 to 31 of fixation was stable for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, but gradually declined for hookworm, starting at day 15.', ""A single FLOTAC is more sensitive than triplicate Kato-Katz for the diagnosis of low-intensity soil-transmitted helminth infections Accurate diagnostic toots are pivotal for patient management and surveillance of helminth control programmes, particularly in the current era of preventive chemotherapy. Three consecutive stool samples were obtained from 279 schoolchildren from Zanzibar, an island where anthelminthic drugs have been administered on a large scale for more than a decade. All stool samples were examined with the Kato-Katz method. Additionally, one sample per child was preserved in sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin solution, and examined with the FLOTAC technique. Considering the pooled results of both methods as diagnostic 'gold' standard, the observed prevalences of Trichuris trichiura, hookworm and Ascaris lumbricoides were 63.4, 35.8 and 22.9%, respectively. The sensitivity of examining a single stool sample by FLOTAC for diagnosing T. trichiura, hookworm and A. lumbricoides was 88.7, 83.0 and 82.8%, respectively. Lower sensitivities were observed for Kato-Katz even after examining three stool samples: 71.8, 46.0 and 70.3%, respectively. Kato-Katz revealed considerably higher infection intensities than FLOTAC. The K agreement between a single FLOTAC and triplicate Kato-Katz was 0.63 for diagnosing A. lumbricoides and 0.50 for T. trichiura, but only 0.30 for hookworm.

92,120,92_neurodegenerative_neurodegeneration_dopaminergic_neuronal,"[""f Lack of additive role of ageing in nigrostriatal neurodegeneration triggered by alpha-synuclein overexpression Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons as well as the presence of proteinaceous inclusions named Lewy bodies. alpha synuclein (alpha-syn) is a major constituent of Lewy bodies, and the first disease-causing protein characterized in PD. Several alpha-syn-based animal models of PD have been developed to investigate the pathophysiology of PD, but none of them recapitulate the full picture of the disease. Ageing is the most compelling and major risk factor for developing PD but its impact on alpha-syn toxicity remains however unexplored. In this study, we developed and exploited a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector of serotype 9 overexpressing mutated alpha-syn to elucidate the influence of ageing on the dynamics of PD-related neurodegeneration associated with alpha-syn pathology in different mammalian species. Conclusions: In conclusion, AAV2/9-mediated h alpha-syn induces robust nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in mice, rats and monkeys, allowing translational comparisons among species. Ageing, however, neither exacerbated nigrostriatal neurodegeneration nor alpha-syn pathology per se. Our unprecedented multi-species investigation thus favours the multiple-hit hypothesis for PD wherein ageing would merely be an aggravating, additive, factor superimposed upon an independent disease process. Results: Identical AAV pseudotype 2/9 vectors carrying the DNA for human mutant p.A53T alpha-syn were injected into the substantia nigra to induce neurodegeneration and synucleinopathy in mice, rats and monkeys. Rats were used first to validate the ability of this serotype to replicate alpha-syn pathology and second to investigate the relationship between the kinetics of alpha-syn-induced nigrostriatal degeneration and the progressive onset of motor dysfunctions, strikingly reminiscent of the impairments observed in PD patients. In mice, AAV2/9-h alpha-syn injection into the substantia nigra was associated with accumulation of alpha-syn and phosphorylated h alpha-syn, regardless of mouse strain. However, phenotypic mutants with either accelerated senescence or resistance to senescence did not display differential susceptibility to h alpha-syn overexpression. Of note, p-alpha-syn levels correlated with nigrostriatal degeneration in mice. In monkeys, h alpha-syn-induced degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway was not affected by the age of the animals. Unlike mice, m onkeys did not exhibit correlations between levels of phosphorylated alpha-syn and neurodegeneration."", ""alpha-Synucleinopathy and selective dopaminergic neuron loss in a rat lentiviral-based model of Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions named Lewy bodies. Two missense mutations of the alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn; A30P and A53T) have been described in several families with an autosomal dominant form of PD. alpha-Syn also constitutes one of the main components of Lewy bodies in sporadic cases of PD. To develop an animal model of PD, lentiviral vectors expressing different human or rat forms of alpha-syn were injected into the substantia nigra of rats. in contrast to transgenic mice models, a selective loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons associated with a dopaminergic denervation of the striatum was observed in animals expressing either wild-type or mutant forms of human alpha-syn. This neuronal degeneration correlates with the appearance of abundant alpha-syn-positive inclusions and extensive neuritic pathology detected with both alpha-syn and silver staining. Lentiviral-mediated expression of wild-type or mutated forms of human alpha-syn recapitulates the essential neuropathological features of PD. Rat alpha-syn similarly leads to protein aggregation but without cell loss, suggesting that inclusions are not the primary cause of cell degeneration in PD. Viral-mediated genetic models may contribute to elucidate the mechanism of alpha-syn-induced cell death and allow the screening of candidate therapeutic molecules."", ""Interactions among alpha-synuclein, dopamine, and biomembranes - Some clues for understanding neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurologic disorder resulting from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Two lines of evidence suggest that the protein alpha-synuclein plays a role in the pathogenesis of PD: Fibrillar alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies in diseased neurons, and two mutations in alpha-synuclein are linked to early-onset disease. Accordingly, the fibrillization of alpha-synuclein is proposed to contribute to neurodegeneration in PD. In this report, we provide evidence that oligomeric intermediates of the alpha-synuclein fibrillization pathway, termed protofibrils, might be neurotoxic. Analyses of protofibrillar alpha-synuclein by atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy indicate that the oligomers consist of spheres, chains, and rings. alpha-Synuclein protofibrils permeabilize synthetic vesicles and form pore-like assemblies on the surface of brain-derived vesicles. Dopamine reacts with alpha-synuclein to form a covalent adduct that slows the conversion of protofibrils to fibrils. This finding suggests that cytosolic dopamine in dopaminergic neurons promotes the accumulation of toxic alpha-synuclein protofibrils, which might explain why these neurons are most vulnerable to degeneration in PD. Finally, we note that aggregation of alpha-synuclein likely occurs via different mechanisms in the cell versus the test tube. For example, the binding of alpha-synuclein to cellular membranes might influence its self-assembly To address this point, we have developed a yeast model that might enable the selection of random alpha-synuclein mutants with different membrane-binding affinities. These variants might be useful to test whether membrane binding by alpha-synuclein is necessary for neurodegeneration in transgenic animal models of PD.""]","['neurodegenerative', 'neurodegeneration', 'dopaminergic', 'neuronal', 'neuron', 'synuclein', 'synucleinopathies', 'neurons', 'neuroprotective', 'dopamine']",dopamine,Neurodegeneration,Neurodegeneration,dopamine,Neurodegenerative Disorders,Neurodegenerative Diseases,19
93,119,93_perception_retinotopic_vision_visual,"['Non-retinotopic feature processing in the absence of retinotopic spatial layout and the construction of perceptual space from motion The spatial representation of a visual scene in the early visual system is well known. The optics of the eye map the three-dimensional environment onto two-dimensional images on the retina. These retinotopic representations are preserved in the early visual system. Retinotopic representations and processing are among the most prevalent concepts in visual neuroscience. However, it has long been known that a retinotopic representation of the stimulus is neither sufficient nor necessary for perception. Saccadic Stimulus Presentation Paradigm and the Ternus-Pikler displays have been used to investigate non-retinotopic processes with and without eye movements, respectively. However, neither of these paradigms eliminates the retinotopic representation of the spatial layout of the stimulus. Here, we investigated how stimulus features are processed in the absence of a retinotopic layout and in the presence of retinotopic conflict. We used anorthoscopic viewing (slit viewing) and pitted a retinotopic feature-processing hypothesis against a non-retinotopic feature-processing hypothesis. Our results support the predictions of the non-retinotopic feature-processing hypothesis and demonstrate the ability of the visual system to operate non-retinotopically at a fine feature processing level in the absence of a retinotopic spatial layout. Our results suggest that perceptual space is actively constructed from the perceptual dimension of motion. The implications of these findings for normal ecological viewing conditions are discussed. (c) 2012  Ltd. All rights reserved.', 'Retinotopy of visual masking and non-retinotopic perception during masking Due to the movements of the observer and those of objects in the environment, retinotopic representations are highly unstable during ecological viewing conditions. The phenomenal stability of our perception suggests that retinotopic representations are transformed into non-retinotopic representations. It remains to show, however, which visual processes operate under retinotopic representations and which ones operate under non-retinotopic representations. Visual masking refers to the reduced visibility of one stimulus, called the target, due to the presence of a second stimulus, called the mask. Masking has been used extensively to study the dynamic aspects of visual perception. Previous studies using Saccadic Stimulus Presentation Paradigm (SSPP) suggested both retinotopic and non-retinotopic bases for visual masking. In order to understand how the visual system deals with retinotopic changes induced by moving targets, we investigated the retinotopy of visual masking and the fate of masked targets under conditions that do not involve eye movements. We have developed a series of experiments based on a radial Ternus-Pikler display. In this paradigm, the perceived Ternus-Pikler motion is used as a non-retinotopic reference frame to pit retinotopic against non-retinotopic visual masking hypothesis. Our results indicate that both metacontrast and structure masking are retinotopic. We also show that, under conditions that allow observers to read-out effectively non-retinotopic feature attribution, the target becomes visible at a destination different from its retinotopic/spatiotopic location. We discuss the implications of our findings within the context of ecological vision and dynamic form perception.', 'Perceptual Learning in a Nonretinotopic Frame of Reference Perceptual learning is the ability to improve perception through practice. Perceptual learning is usually specific for the task and features learned. For example, improvements in performance for a certain stimulus do not transfer if the stimulus is rotated by 90 or is presented at a different location. These findings are usually taken as evidence that orientation-specific, retinotopic encoding processes are changed during training. In this study, we used a novel masking paradigm in which the offset in an invisible, oblique vernier stimulus was perceived in an aligned vertical or horizontal flanking stimulus presented at a different location. Our results show that learning is specific for the perceived orientation of the vernier offset but not for its actual orientation and location. Specific encoding processes cannot be invoked to explain this improvement. We propose that perceptual learning involves changes in nonretinotopic, attentional readout processes.']","['perception', 'retinotopic', 'vision', 'visual', 'perceived', 'stimuli', 'stimulus', 'perceptual', 'illusion', 'neural']",biology,Perception,Vision,biology,Visual Perception,Visual Perception,19

The heritability of sleep patterns has been shown in studies of monozygotic twins, and sleep electroencephalogram patterns offer a unique genetic fingerprint which may assist in the identification of genes involved in the regulation of sleep. Genetic factors are also thought to play a role in sleep disorders; narcolepsy is a disabling sleep condition and research has revealed the complexity of underlying genetic and environmental influences in the development of this disorder. An understanding of sleep regulation at the molecular level is essential in the identification of new targets for the treatment of sleep disorders, and genome-wide association Studies for both normal sleep and sleep disorders may shed new light on the molecular architecture of mechanisms regulating these behaviours.

All rights reserved.', 'Rapid fast-delta decay following prolonged wakefulness marks a phase of wake-inertia in NREM sleep Sleep-wake driven changes in non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM) sleep (NREMS) EEG delta (delta-)power are widely used as proxy for a sleep homeostatic process. Here, we noted frequency increases in delta -waves in sleep-deprived mice, prompting us to re-evaluate how slow-wave characteristics relate to prior sleep-wake history. We identified two classes of delta -waves; one responding to sleep deprivation with high initial power and fast, discontinuous decay during recovery sleep (delta 2) and another unrelated to time-spent-awake with slow, linear decay (delta 1). Reanalysis of previously published datasets demonstrates that delta -band heterogeneity after sleep deprivation is also present in human subjects. Similar to sleep deprivation, silencing of centromedial thalamus neurons boosted subsequent delta 2-waves, specifically. delta 2-dynamics paralleled that of temperature, muscle tone, heart rate, and neuronal ON-/OFF-state lengths, all reverting to characteristic NREMS levels within the first recovery hour. Thus, prolonged waking seems to necessitate a physiological recalibration before typical NREMS can be reinstated. Changes in EEG delta-activity are widely used as proxy of sleep propensity. Here the authors demonstrate in mice and humans the presence of two types of delta-waves, only one of which reports on prior sleep-wake history with dynamics denoting a wake-inertia process accompanying deepest non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM) sleep.', 'Homeostatic and Circadian Contribution to EEG and Molecular State Variables of Sleep Regulation Interventions: Sleep deprivation. Study Objectives: Besides their well-established role in circadian rhythms, our findings that the forebrain expression of the clock-genes Per2 and Dbp increases and decreases, respectively, in relation to time spent awake suggest they also play a role in the homeostatic aspect of sleep regulation. Here, we determined whether time of day modulates the effects of elevated sleep pressure on clock-gene expression. Time of day effects were assessed also for recognized electrophysiological (EEG delta power) and molecular (Homer1a) markers of sleep homeostasis. Results: The sleep-deprivation induced changes in Per2 and Dbp expression importantly varied with time of day, such that Per2 could even decrease during sleep deprivations occurring at the decreasing phase in baseline. Dbp showed similar, albeit opposite dynamics. These unexpected results could be reliably predicted assuming that these transcripts behave according to a driven damped harmonic oscillator. As expected, the sleep-wake distribution accounted for a large degree of the changes in EEG delta power and Homer1a. Nevertheless, the sleep deprivation-induced increase in delta power varied also with time of day with higher than expected levels when recovery sleep started at dark onset. Setting: Mouse sleep laboratory. Design: EEG and qPCR data were obtained for baseline and recovery from 6-h sleep deprivation starting at ZT0, -6, -12, or -18. Participants: Male mice. Conclusions: Per2 and delta power are widely used as exclusive state variables of the circadian and homeostatic process, respectively. Our findings demonstrate a considerable cross-talk between these two processes. As Per2 in the brain responds to both sleep loss and time of day, this molecule is well positioned to keep track of and to anticipate homeostatic sleep need.']","['sleepiness', 'sleep', 'circadian', 'sleeping', 'wakefulness', 'rhythms', 'night', 'wake', 'awake', 'waking']",wakefulness,Sleep,sleep,wakefulness,Sleep Rhythms,Sleep and Circadian Rhythms,19

Results: In the health facility survey, a prescriber or nurse was present on the day of the survey in about 40% of 114 dispensaries. Less than half of health facilities had all seven &apos; essential oral treatments&apos;, and water was available in only 22%. In the household survey, antenatal attendance (88%) and DPT-HepB3 vaccine coverage in children (81%) were high. Neonatal and infant mortality were 43.2 and 76.4 per 1000 live births respectively. Infant mortality was 40% higher for teenage mothers than older women (RR 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.7), and 20% higher for mothers with no formal education than those who had been to school (RR 1.2, CI 1.0-1.4). The benefits of education on survival were apparently restricted to post-neonatal infants. There was no evidence of inequality in infant mortality by socio-economic status. Vaccine coverage, net use, anaemia and parasitaemia were inequitable: the least poor had a consistent advantage over children from the poorest families. Infant mortality was higher in families living over 5 km from their nearest health facility compared to those living closer (RR 1.25, CI 1.0-1.5): 75% of households live within this distance. Conclusion: Relatively short distances to health facilities, high antenatal and vaccine coverage show that peripheral health facilities have huge potential to make a difference to health and survival at household level in rural Tanzania, even with current human resources. Methods: We documented availability of health workers, vaccines, drugs, supplies and services essential for child health through a survey of all health facilities in the area. We did a representative cluster sample survey of 21,600 households using a modular questionnaire including household assets, birth histories, and antenatal care in currently pregnant women. In a subsample of households we asked about health of all children under two years, including breastfeeding, mosquito net use, vaccination, vitamin A, and care-seeking for recent illness, and measured haemoglobin and malaria parasitaemia.', ""Selected indicators and determinants of women's health in the vicinity of a copper mine development in northwestern Zambia Background: Large projects in the extractive industry sector can affect people's health and wellbeing. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), women's health is of particular concern in such contexts due to potential educational and economic disadvantages, vulnerability to transactional sex and unsafe sex practices. At the same time, community health interventions and development initiatives present opportunities for women's and maternal health. Results: All measured indicators improved over time, regardless of whether communities were affected by the project or not. Additionally, the percentage of mothers giving birth in a health facility, the percentage of women who acknowledge that HIV cannot be transmitted by witchcraft or other supernatural means and the percentage of women having ever tested for HIV showed a significant increase in the impacted sites but not in the comparison communities. In 2015, better health, behavioural and knowledge outcomes in women were associated with employment by the project (or a sub-contractor thereof), migration background, increased wealth and higher educational attainment. Methods: Within the frame of the health impact assessment (HIA) of the Trident copper mining project in Zambia, two health surveys were conducted (baseline in 2011 and follow-up in 2015) in order to monitor health and health-related indicators. Emphasis was placed on women residing in the mining area and, for comparison, in settings not impacted by the project. Conclusions: Our study reveals that natural resource development projects can positively impact women's health, particularly if health risks are adequately anticipated and managed. Hence, the conduct of a comprehensive HIA should be a requirement at the feasibility stage of any large infrastructure project, particularly in LMICs.

Negative effects often prevail and these might widen existing health inequities. Health impact assessment (HIA) is a decision-support tool that aims at maximizing benefits and minimizing negative impacts on people\'s health. A core value of HIA is equity; yet, little is known about health equity in the frame of HIA, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Methodology: We conducted a scoping review to determine whether and to what extent HIA in sub-Saharan Africa addresses health equity. We included peer-reviewed publications and guidelines pertaining to HIA, environmental impact assessment (EIA) and social impact assessment (SIA). Health equity was investigated by identifying (i) how health considerations were addressed and (ii) whether health was stratified by subgroups of the community. Conclusions: We found evidence that previously conducted HIA in sub-Saharan Africa and current guidelines address health equity. However, there is a need to stratify community subgroups more systematically in order to determine health differentials better. Future HIA should consider community heterogeneity in an effort to reduce health inequities by ""leaving no one behind"", as suggested by the Sustainable Development Goals. Results: Out of 1\'640 raw hits, we identified 62 articles (16 HIA, 36 EIA, one SIA and nine integrated assessments), 32 of which specifically addressed health. While 20 articles focused on a specific health topic, 12 articles used a more comprehensive approach to address health. In 15 articles there were specific subgroup analyses (e.g. mothers, children or marginalized groups) as a measure of health equity. Another 12 papers referred to the community in a more general way (e.g. affected). Without exception, health was an integral part of the nine included guidelines.

They protect chromosome ends from DNA degradation, recombination, and DNA end fusions, and they are important for nuclear architecture. Telomeres provide a mechanism for their replication by semiconservative DNA replication and length maintenance by telomerase. Through telomerase repression and induced telomere shortening, telomeres provide the means to regulate cellular life span. In this review, we introduce the current knowledge on telomere composition and structure. We then discuss in depth the current understanding of how telomere components mediate their function during semiconservative DNA replication and how telomerase is regulated at the end of the chromosome. We focus our discussion on the telomeres from mammals and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.', 'The human CST complex is a terminator of telomerase activity The lengths of human telomeres, which protect chromosome ends from degradation and end fusions(1,2), are crucial determinants of cell lifespan(3). During embryogenesis and in cancer, the telomerase enzyme counteracts telomeric DNA shortening. As shown in cancer cells, human telomerase binds the shelterin component TPP1 at telomeres(4,5) during the S phase of the cell cycle, and adds similar to 60 nucleotides in a single round of extension(6), after which telomerase is turned off by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that the human CST (CTC1, STN1 and TEN1) complex, previously implicated in telomere protection and DNA metabolism(7-11), inhibits telomerase activity through primer sequestration and physical interaction with the protection of telomeres 1 (POT1)-TPP1 telomerase processivity factor(12,13). CST competes with POT1-TPP1 for telomeric DNA, and CST-telomeric-DNA binding increases during late S/G2 phase only on telomerase action, coinciding with telomerase shut-off. Depletion of CST allows excessive telomerase activity, promoting telomere elongation. We propose that through binding of the telomerase-extended telomere, CST limits telomerase action at individual telomeres to approximately one binding and extension event per cell cycle. Our findings define the sequence of events that occur to first enable and then terminate telomerase-mediated telomere elongation.', 'Early replication of short telomeres in budding yeast The maintenance of an appropriate number of telomere repeats by telomerase is essential for proper chromosome protection. The action of telomerase at the telomere terminus is regulated by opposing activities that either recruit/activate the enzyme at shorter telomeres or inhibit it at longer ones, thus achieving a stable average telomere length. To elucidate the mechanistic details of telomerase regulation we engineered specific chromosome ends in yeast so that a single telomere could be suddenly shortened and, as a consequence of its reduced length, elongated by telomerase. We show that shortened telomeres replicate early in S phase, unlike normal-length telomeres, due to the early firing of origins of DNA replication in subtelomeric regions. Early telomere replication correlates with increased telomere length and telomerase activity. These data reveal an epigenetic effect of telomere length on the activity of nearby replication origins and an unanticipated link between telomere replication timing and telomerase action.']","['telomerase', 'telomeres', 'telomere', 'telomeric', 'chromosome', 'chromosomal', 'chromosomes', 'transcriptase', 'gene', 'transcription']",telomerase,Telomeres,Telomeres,telomerase,Telomere Biology,Telomere Maintenance,19

However, the mechanisms through which this neuromodulation therapy engages spinal circuits remain enigmatic. Using computer simulations and behavioral experiments, we provide evidence that epidural electrical stimulation interacts with muscle spindle feedback circuits to modulate muscle activity during locomotion. Hypothesis-driven strategies emerging from simulations steered the design of stimulation protocols that adjust bilateral hindlimb kinematics throughout gait execution. These stimulation strategies corrected subject-specific gait and balance deficits in rats with incomplete and complete spinal cord injury. The conservation of muscle spindle feedback circuits across mammals suggests that the same mechanisms may facilitate motor control in humans. These results provide a conceptual framework to improve stimulation protocols for clinical applications.', 'A brain-spine interface alleviating gait deficits after spinal cord injury in primates Spinal cord injury disrupts the communication between the brain and the spinal circuits that orchestrate movement. To bypass the lesion, brain-computer interfaces(1-3) have directly linked cortical activity to electrical stimulation of muscles, and have thus restored grasping abilities after hand paralysis(1,4). Theoretically, this strategy could also restore control over leg muscle activity for walking(5). However, replicating the complex sequence of individual muscle activation patterns underlying natural and adaptive locomotor movements poses formidable conceptual and technological challenges(6,7). Recently, it was shown in rats that epidural electrical stimulation of the lumbar spinal cord can reproduce the natural activation of synergistic muscle groups producing locomotion(8-10). Here we interface leg motor cortex activity with epidural electrical stimulation protocols to establish a brain-spine interface that alleviated gait deficits after a spinal cord injury in non-human primates. Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were implanted with an intracortical microelectrode array in the leg area of the motor cortex and with a spinal cord stimulation system composed of a spatially selective epidural implant and a pulse generator with realtime triggering capabilities. We designed and implemented wireless control systems that linked online neural decoding of extension and flexion motor states with stimulation protocols promoting these movements. These systems allowed the monkeys to behave freely without any restrictions or constraining tethered electronics. After validation of the brain-spine interface in intact (uninjured) monkeys, we performed a unilateral corticospinal tract lesion at the thoracic level. As early as six days post-injury and without prior training of the monkeys, the brain-spine interface restored weight-bearing locomotion of the paralysed leg on a treadmill and overground. The implantable components integrated in the brain-spine interface have all been approved for investigational applications in similar human research, suggesting a practical translational pathway for proof-of-concept studies in people with spinal cord injury.', 'Motor deficits and recovery in rats with unilateral spinal cord hemisection mimic the Brown-Sequard syndrome Cervical incomplete spinal cord injuries often lead to severe and persistent impairments of sensorimotor functions and are clinically the most frequent type of spinal cord injury. Understanding the motor impairments and the possible functional recovery of upper and lower extremities is of great importance. Animal models investigating motor dysfunction following cervical spinal cord injury are rare. We analysed the differential spontaneous recovery of fore- and hindlimb locomotion by detailed kinematic analysis in adult rats with unilateral C4/C5 hemisection, a lesion that leads to the Brown-Sequard syndrome in humans. The results showed disproportionately better performance of hindlimb compared with forelimb locomotion; hindlimb locomotion showed substantial recovery, whereas the ipsilesional forelimb remained in a very poor functional state. Such a differential motor recovery pattern is also known to occur in monkeys and in humans after similar spinal cord lesions. On the lesioned side, cortico-, rubro-, vestibulo- and reticulospinal tracts and the important modulatory serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic fibre systems were interrupted by the lesion. In an attempt to facilitate locomotion, different monoaminergic agonists were injected intrathecally. Injections of specific serotonergic and noradrenergic agonists in the chronic phase after the spinal cord lesion revealed remarkable, although mostly functionally negative, modulations of particular parameters of hindlimb locomotion. In contrast, forelimb locomotion was mostly unresponsive to these agonists. These results, therefore, show fundamental differences between fore- and hindlimb spinal motor circuitries and their functional dependence on remaining descending inputs and exogenous spinal excitation. Understanding these differences may help to develop future therapeutic strategies to improve upper and lower limb function in patients with incomplete cervical spinal cord injuries.']","['neuromodulation', 'spinal', 'neurological', 'neuroprosthetic', 'neural', 'locomotion', 'neurons', 'stimulation', 'rehabilitation', 'cortex']",neuromodulation,Neuromodulation,Neurorehabilitation,neuromodulation,Neural Rehabilitation,Neural Rehabilitation,19

However, methods for investigating the global chain dynamics of these structurally diverse systems have been limited. A versatile experimental approach is single-molecule spectroscopy in combination with Forster resonance energy transfer and nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The concepts of polymer physics offer a powerful framework both for interpreting the results and for understanding and classifying the properties of unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins. This information on long-range chain dynamics can be complemented with spectroscopic techniques that probe different length scales and time scales, and integration of these results greatly benefits from recent advances in molecular simulations. This increasing convergence between the experiment, theory, and simulation is thus starting to enable an increasingly detailed view of the dynamics of disordered proteins. Published by AIP Publishing.', 'Single-molecule spectroscopy of the temperature-induced collapse of unfolded proteins We used single-molecule FRET in combination with other biophysical methods and molecular simulations to investigate the effect of temperature on the dimensions of unfolded proteins. With single-molecule FRET, this question can be addressed even under nearnative conditions, where most molecules are folded, allowing us to probe a wide range of denaturant concentrations and temperatures. We find a compaction of the unfolded state of a small cold shock protein with increasing temperature in both the presence and the absence of denaturant, with good agreement between the results from single-molecule FRET and dynamic light scattering. Although dissociation of denaturant from the polypeptide chain with increasing temperature accounts for part of the compaction, the results indicate an important role for additional temperature-dependent interactions within the unfolded chain. The observation of a collapse of a similar extent in the extremely hydrophilic, intrinsically disordered protein prothymosin alpha suggests that the hydrophobic effect is not the sole source of the underlying interactions. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water show changes in secondary structure content with increasing temperature and suggest a contribution of intramolecular hydrogen bonding to unfolded state collapse.', 'Combining short- and long-range fluorescence reporters with simulations to explore the intramolecular dynamics of an intrinsically disordered protein Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are increasingly recognized as a class of molecules that can exert essential biological functions even in the absence of a well-defined three-dimensional structure. Understanding the conformational distributions and dynamics of these highly flexible proteins is thus essential for explaining the molecular mechanisms underlying their function. Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a powerful tool for probing intramolecular distances and the rapid long-range distance dynamics in IDPs. To complement the information from FRET, we combine it with photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching to monitor local loop-closure kinetics at the same time and in the same molecule. Here we employed this combination to investigate the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of HIV-1 integrase. The results show that both long-range dynamics and loop closure kinetics on the sub-microsecond time scale can be obtained reliably from a single set of measurements by the analysis with a comprehensive model of the underlying photon statistics including both FRET and PET. A more detailed molecular interpretation of the results is enabled by direct comparison with a recent extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulation of integrase. The simulations are in good agreement with experiment and can explain the deviation from simple models of chain dynamics by the formation of persistent local secondary structure. The results illustrate the power of a close combination of single-molecule spectroscopy and simulations for advancing our understanding of the dynamics and detailed mechanisms in unfolded and intrinsically disordered proteins.

Future studies should investigate whether temporal declines in spirochete load occur in wild Ixodes ticks under natural conditions and whether these declines influence the tick-to-host transmission of Borrelia. Methods: Larval ticks from our laboratory colony of I. ricinus were experimentally infected with B. afzelii, and killed at 1 month and 4 months after the larva-to-nymph moult. The spirochete load was also compared between engorged larval ticks and unfed nymphs (from the same cohort) and between unfed nymphs and unfed adult ticks (from the same cohort). The spirochete load of B. afzelii in each tick was estimated using qPCR. Results: The mean spirochete load in the 1-month-old nymphs (similar to 14,000 spirochetes) was seven times higher than the 4-month-old nymphs (similar to 2000 spirochetes). Thus, the nymphal spirochete load declined by 80% over a period of 3 months. An engorged larval tick acquired similar to 100 spirochetes, and this population was 20 times larger in a young, unfed nymph. The spirochete load also appeared to decline in adult ticks.

Tick-borne spirochete bacteria of the Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) species complex cause Lyme borreliosis in humans and spend long periods of time (> 12 months) in their Ixodes tick vectors. To date, few studies have investigated the dynamics of Borrelia spirochete populations in unfed Ixodes nymphal ticks.', 'Competition Between Strains of Borrelia afzelii in Immature Ixodes ricinus Ticks Is Not Affected by Season Vector-borne pathogens often consist of genetically distinct strains that can establish co-infections in the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector. Co-infections (or mixed infections) can result in competitive interactions between strains with important consequences for strain abundance and transmission. Here we used the spirochete bacterium, Borrelia afzelii, as a model system to investigate the interactions between strains inside its tick vector, Ixodes ricinus. Larvae were fed on mice infected with either one or two strains of B. afzelii. Engorged larvae were allowed to molt into nymphs that were subsequently exposed to three seasonal treatments (artificial summer, artificial winter, and natural winter), which differed in temperature and light conditions. We used strain-specific qPCRs to quantify the presence and abundance of each strain in the immature ticks. Co-infection in the mice reduced host-to-tick transmission to larval ticks and this effect was maintained in the resultant nymphs at 1 and 4 months after the larva-to-nymph molt. Competition between strains in co-infected ticks reduced the abundance of both strains. This inter-strain competition occurred in the three life stages that we investigated: engorged larvae, recently molted nymphs, and overwintered nymphs. The abundance of B. afzelii in the nymphs declined by 40.5% over a period of 3 months, but this phenomenon was not influenced by the seasonal treatment. Future studies should investigate whether inter-strain competition in the tick influences the subsequent strain-specific transmission success from the tick to the vertebrate host.', 'Multistrain Infections with Lyme Borreliosis Pathogens in the Tick Vector IMPORTANCE Lyme borreliosis is the most common vector-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere and is caused by spirochete bacteria that belong to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex. These tick-borne pathogens are transmitted among vertebrate hosts by hard ticks of the genus Ixodes. Each Borrelia species can be further subdivided into genetically distinct strains. Multiple-strain infections are common in both the vertebrate host and the tick vector and can result in competitive interactions. To date, few studies on multiple-strain vector-borne pathogens have investigated patterns of cooccurrence and abundance in the arthropod vector. We demonstrate that the abundance of a given strain in the tick vector is negatively affected by the presence of coinfecting strains. In addition, our study suggests that the spirochete abundance in the tick is an important life history trait that can explain why some strains are more common in nature than others. Mixed or multiple-strain infections are common in vector-borne diseases and have important implications for the epidemiology of these pathogens. Previous studies have mainly focused on interactions between pathogen strains in the vertebrate host, but little is known about what happens in the arthropod vector. Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii are two species of spirochete bacteria that cause Lyme borreliosis in Europe and that share a tick vector, Ixodes ricinus. Each of these two tick-borne pathogens consists of multiple strains that are often differentiated using the highly polymorphic ospC gene. For each Borrelia species, we studied the frequencies and abundances of the ospC strains in a wild population of I. ricinus ticks that had been sampled from the same field site over a period of 3 years. We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 454 sequencing to estimate the spirochete load and the strain diversity within each tick. For B. afzelii, there was a negative relationship between the two most common ospC strains, suggesting the presence of competitive interactions in the vertebrate host and possibly the tick vector. The flat relationship between total spirochete abundance and strain richness in the nymphal tick indicates that the mean abundance per strain decreases as the number of strains in the tick increases. Strains with the highest spirochete load in the nymphal tick were the most common strains in the tick population. The spirochete abundance in the nymphal tick appears to be an important life history trait that explains why some strains are more common than others in nature.']","['infestation', 'ticks', 'infested', 'pathogen', 'pathogens', 'tick', 'borreliosis', 'rodents', 'infected', 'disease']",tick,Ticks,Lyme,tick,Tick-Borne Diseases,Tick-Borne Diseases,19

Here, we show that in S. cerevisiae, activation of the CDK Cdc28-Cln2 at bud emergence triggers relocalization of Cdc24, the GEF for Cdc42, from the nucleus to the polarization site, where it is stably maintained by binding to the adaptor Bem1. Locally activated Cdc42 then polarizes the cytoskeleton in a manner dependent on its effecters Bni1 and the PAK-like kinase Cla4. In addition, Cla4 induces phosphorylation of Cdc24, leading to its dissociation from Bem1 at bud tips, thereby ending polarized bud growth in vivo. Our results thus suggest a dynamic temporal and spatial regulation of the Cdc42 module: Cdc28-Cln triggers actin polarization by activating Cdc42, which in turn restricts its own activation via a negative feedback loop acting on its GEF Cdc24.', 'Polar gradients of the DYRK-family kinase Pom1 couple cell length with the cell cycle Cells normally grow to a certain size before they enter mitosis and divide. Entry into mitosis depends on the activity of Cdk1, which is inhibited by the Wee1 kinase and activated by the Cdc25 phosphatase(1). However, how cells sense their size for mitotic commitment remains unknown. Here we show that an intracellular gradient of the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase (DYRK) Pom1, which emanates from the ends of rod-shaped Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells, serves to measure cell length and control mitotic entry. Pom1 provides positional information both for polarized growth and to inhibit cell division at cell ends(2-5). We discovered that Pom1 is also a dose-dependent G2-M inhibitor. Genetic analyses indicate that Pom1 negatively regulates Cdr1 and Cdr2, two previously described Wee1 inhibitors of the SAD kinase family(6-10). This inhibition may be direct, because in vivo and in vitro evidence suggest that Pom1 phosphorylates Cdr2. Whereas Cdr1 and Cdr2 localize to a medial cortical region, Pom1 forms concentration gradients from cell tips that overlap with Cdr1 and Cdr2 in short cells, but not in long cells. Disturbing these Pom1 gradients leads to Cdr2 phosphorylation and imposes a G2 delay. In short cells, Pom1 prevents precocious M-phase entry, suggesting that the higher medial Pom1 levels inhibit Cdr2 and promote a G2 delay. Thus, gradients of Pom1 from cell ends provide a measure of cell length to regulate M-phase entry.', 'Cdc42 Explores the Cell Periphery for Mate Selection in Fission Yeast How cells polarize in response to external cues is a fundamental biological problem. For mating, yeast cells orient growth toward the source of a pheromone gradient produced by cells of the opposite mating type [1, 2]. Polarized growth depends on the small GTPase Cdc42, a central eukaryotic polarity regulator that controls signaling, cytoskeleton polarization, and vesicle trafficking [3]. However, the mechanisms of polarity establishment and mate selection in complex cellular environments are poorly understood. Here we show that, in fission yeast, low-level pheromone signaling promotes a novel polarization state, where active Cdc42, its GEF Scd1, and scaffold Scd2 form colocalizing dynamic zones that sample the periphery of the cell. Two direct Cdc42 effectors-actin cables marked by myosin V Myo52 and the exocyst complex labeled by Sec6 and Sec8-also dynamically colocalize with active Cdc42. However, these cells do not grow due to a block in the exocytosis of cell wall synthases Bgs1 and Bgs4. High-level pheromone stabilizes active Cdc42 zones and promotes cell wall synthase exocytosis and polarized growth. However, in the absence of prior low-level pheromone signaling,. exploration fails, and cells polarize growth at cell poles by default. Consequently, these cells show altered partner choice, mating preferentially with sister rather than nonsister cells. Thus, Cdc42 exploration serves to orient growth for partner selection. This process may also promote genetic diversification.']","['cells', 'kinases', 'cell', 'cdr2', 'cdc28', 'signaling', 'kinase', 'polarization', 'cerevisiae', 'polarity']",polarization,Polarity,Cell_signaling,polarization,Cell Signaling,Cell Signaling and Kinases,19

Mitochondrial fusion relies on dynamin-related GTPases, the mitofusins (MFN1 and 2) in the outer mitochondrial membrane and OPA1 (optic atrophy 1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Apart from a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA, little is known about the physiological role of mitochondrial fusion. Here we report that mitochondria hyperfuse and form a highly interconnected network in cells exposed to selective stresses. This process precedes mitochondrial fission when it is triggered by apoptotic stimuli such as UV irradiation or actinomycin D. Stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion (SIMH) is independent of MFN2, BAX/BAK, and prohibitins, but requires L-OPA1, MFN1, and the mitochondrial inner membrane protein SLP-2. In the absence of SLP-2, L-OPA1 is lost and SIMH is prevented. SIMH is accompanied by increased mitochondrial ATP production and represents a novel adaptive pro-survival response against stress.

Although many mitochondrial proteins have been identified, understanding their functional interrelationships has been a challenge. Here we construct a comprehensive network of the mitochondrial system. We integrated genome-wide datasets to generate an accurate and inclusive mitochondrial parts list. Together with benchmarked measures of protein interactions, a network of mitochondria was constructed in their cellular context, including extra-mitochondrial proteins. This network also integrates data from different organisms to expand the known mitochondrial biology beyond the information in the existing databases. Our network brings together annotated and predicted functions into a single framework. This enabled, for the entire system, a survey of mutant phenotypes, gene regulation, evolution, and disease susceptibility. Furthermore, we experimentally validated the localization of several candidate proteins and derived novel functional contexts for hundreds of uncharacterized proteins. Our network thus advances the understanding of the mitochondrial system in yeast and identifies properties of genes underlying human mitochondrial disorders.', 'Preventing Mitochondrial Fission Impairs Mitochondrial Function and Leads to Loss of Mitochondrial DNA Mitochondria form a highly dynamic tubular network, the morphology of which is regulated by frequent fission and fusion events. However, the role of mitochondrial fission in homeostasis of the organelle is still unknown. Here we report that preventing mitochondrial fission, by down-regulating expression of Drp1 in mammalian cells leads to a loss of mitochondrial DNA and a decrease of mitochondrial respiration coupled to an increase in the levels of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). At the cellular level, mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from the lack of fission leads to a drop in the levels of cellular ATP, an inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase in autophagy. In conclusion, we propose that mitochondrial fission is required for preservation of mitochondrial function and thereby for maintenance of cellular homeostasis.']","['mitochondria', 'mitochondrial', 'mitoribosomal', 'mitophagy', 'ribosomes', 'ribosome', 'metabolism', 'biogenesis', 'mitoribosomes', 'cytosolic']",mitoribosome,Mitochondria,mitochondria,mitoribosome,Mitochondrial Biology,Mitochondrial Biology,19
102,103,102_mating_sexes_traits_trait,"['Sexual selection when fertilization is not guaranteed Much of the theory of sexual selection assumes that females do not generally experience difficulties getting their eggs fertilized, yet sperm limitation is occasionally documented. How often does male limitation form a selection for female traits that improve their mating rate? The question is difficult to test, because if such traits evolve to be efficient, sperm limitation will no longer appear to be a problem to females. Here, we suggest that changes in choosiness between populations, and in particular between virgin and mated females, offer an efficient way to test this hypothesis. We model the ""wallflower effect,"" that is, changes in female preferences due to time and mortality costs of remaining unmated (for at least some time). We show that these costs cause adaptive reductions of female choice, even if mate encounter rates appear high and females only rarely end their lives unfertilized. We also consider the population consequences of plastic or fixed mate preferences at different mate encounter rates. If mate choice is plastic, we confirm earlier verbal models that virgins should mate relatively indiscriminately, but plastic increase of choosiness in later matings can compensate and intensity sexual selection on the mate trait, particularly if there is last male sperm precedence. Plastic populations will cope well with unusual conditions: eagerness of virgins leads to high reproductive output and a relaxation of sexual selection at low population densities. If females lack such plasticity, however, population-wide reproductive output may be severely reduced, whereas sexual selection on male traits remains strong.', ""Coevolution of male and female mate choice can destabilize reproductive isolation Sexual interactions play an important role in the evolution of reproductive isolation, with important consequences for speciation. Theoretical studies have focused on the evolution of mate preferences in each sex separately. However, mounting empirical evidence suggests that premating isolation often involves mutual mate choice. Here, using a population genetic model, we investigate how female and male mate choice coevolve under a phenotype matching rule and how this affects reproductive isolation. We show that the evolution of female preferences increases the mating success of males with reciprocal preferences, favouring mutual mate choice. However, the evolution of male preferences weakens indirect selection on female preferences and, with weak genetic drift, the coevolution of female and male mate choice leads to periodic episodes of random mating with increased hybridization (deterministic 'preference cycling' triggered by stochasticity). Thus, counterintuitively, the process of establishing premating isolation proves rather fragile if both male and female mate choice contribute to assortative mating."", 'Can non-directional male mating preferences facilitate honest female ornamentation? Recent studies have demonstrated male mate choice for female ornaments in species without sex-role reversal. Despite these empirical findings, little is known about the adaptive dynamics of female signalling, in particular the evolution of male mating preferences. The evolution of traits that signal mate quality is more complex in females than in males because females usually provide the bulk of resources for the developing offspring. Here, we investigate the evolution of male mating preferences using a mathematical model which: (i) specifically accounts for the fact that females must trade-off resources invested in ornaments with reproduction; and (ii) allows male mating preferences to evolve a non-directional shape. The optimal adaptive strategy for males is to develop stabilizing mating preferences for female display traits to avoid females that either invests too many or too few resources in ornamentation. However, the evolutionary stability of this prediction is dependent upon the level of error made by females when allocating resources to either signal or fecundity.']","['mating', 'sexes', 'traits', 'trait', 'reproduction', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'genetic', 'selection', 'sperm']",biology,Sexuality,reproduction,biology,Sexual Selection,Sexual Selection,19

These behavioral changes contribute to an increased fitness in structured environments and are controlled by the ubiquitous bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP). In response to changing environments, fluctuating levels of c-di-GMP inversely regulate cell motility and cell surface adhesins. Although the synthesis and breakdown of c-di-GMP has been studied in detail, little is known about the downstream effector mechanisms. Using affinity chromatography, we have isolated several c-di-GMP-binding proteins from Caulobacter crescentus. One of these proteins, DgrA, is a PilZ homolog involved in mediating c-di-GMP-dependent control of C crescentus cell motility. Biochemical and structural analysis of DgrA and homologs from C crescentus, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated that this protein family represents a class of specific diguanylate receptors and suggested a general mechanism for c-di-GMP binding and signal transduction. Increased concentrations of c-di-GMP or DgrA blocked motility in C crescentus by interfering with motor function rather than flagellar assembly. We present preliminary evidence implicating the flagellar motor protein FliL in DgrA-dependent cell motility control.', 'Cyclic di-GMP acts as a cell cycle oscillator to drive chromosome replication Fundamental to all living organisms is the capacity to coordinate cell division and cell differentiation to generate appropriate numbers of specialized cells. Whereas eukaryotes use cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases to balance division with cell fate decisions(1), equivalent regulatory systems have not been described in bacteria. Moreover, the mechanisms used by bacteria to tune division in line with developmental programs are poorly understood. Here we show that Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium with an asymmetric division cycle, uses oscillating levels of the second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) to drive its cell cycle. We demonstrate that c-diGMP directly binds to the essential cell cycle kinase CckA to inhibit kinase activity and stimulate phosphatase activity. An upshift of c-di-GMP during the G1-S transition switches CckA from the kinase to the phosphatase mode, thereby allowing replication initiation and cell cycle progression. Finally, we show that during division, c-di-GMP imposes spatial control on CckA to install the replication asymmetry of future daughter cells. These studies reveal c-di-GMP to be a cyclin-like molecule in bacteria that coordinates chromosome replication with cell morphogenesis in Caulobacter. The observation that c-di-GMP-mediated control is conserved in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens suggests a general mechanism through which this global regulator of bacterial virulence and persistence coordinates behaviour and cell proliferation.', 'Bi-modal Distribution of the Second Messenger c-di-GMP Controls Cell Fate and Asymmetry during the Caulobacter Cell Cycle Many bacteria mediate important life-style decisions by varying levels of the second messenger c-di-GMP. Behavioral transitions result from the coordination of complex cellular processes such as motility, surface adherence or the production of virulence factors and toxins. While the regulatory mechanisms responsible for these processes have been elucidated in some cases, the global pleiotropic effects of c-di-GMP are poorly understood, primarily because c-di-GMP networks are inherently complex in most bacteria. Moreover, the quantitative relationships between cellular c-di-GMP levels and c-di-GMP dependent phenotypes are largely unknown. Here, we dissect the c-di-GMP network of Caulobacter crescentus to establish a global and quantitative view of c-di-GMP dependent processes in this organism. A genetic approach that gradually reduced the number of diguanylate cyclases identified novel c-di-GMP dependent cellular processes and unraveled c-di-GMP as an essential component of C. crescentus cell polarity and its bimodal life cycle. By varying cellular c-di-GMP concentrations, we determined dose response curves for individual c-di-GMP-dependent processes. Relating these values to c-di-GMP levels modeled for single cells progressing through the cell cycle sets a quantitative frame for the successive activation of c-di-GMP dependent processes during the C. crescentus life cycle. By reconstructing a simplified c-di-GMP network in a strain devoid of c-di-GMP we defined the minimal requirements for the oscillation of c-di-GMP levels during the C. crescentus cell cycle. Finally, we show that although all c-di-GMP dependent cellular processes were qualitatively restored by artificially adjusting c-di-GMP levels with a heterologous diguanylate cyclase, much higher levels of the second messenger are required under these conditions as compared to the contribution of homologous c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes. These experiments suggest that a common c-di-GMP pool cannot fully explain spatiotemporal regulation by c-di-GMP in C. crescentus and that individual enzymes preferentially regulate specific phenotypes during the cell cycle.']","['bacterial', 'bacteria', 'caulobacter', 'proteins', 'diguanylate', 'mechanism', 'biofilm', 'cellular', 'protein', 'transcriptional']",biofilm,Biofilm,Bacteria,biofilm,Bacterial Biofilm Mechanisms,Bacterial Protein Mechanisms,19
